The film tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne ([[Tim Robbins]]), who is [[Life imprisonment|sentenced to life]] in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis \\\"Red\\\" Redding ([[Morgan Freeman]]), and becomes instrumental in a [[money laundering]] operation led by the [[prison warden]] Samuel Norton ([[Bob Gunton]]). [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]], [[Clancy Brown]], [[Gil Bellows]], and [[James Whitmore]] appear in supporting roles.\\n\\nDarabont purchased the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to [[Castle Rock Entertainment]], Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce ''The Shawshank Redemption'', which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in [[Maine]], [[principal photography]] took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in [[Mansfield, Ohio]], with the [[Ohio State Reformatory]] serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars for the role of Andy, including [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tom Cruise]], and [[Kevin Costner]]. [[Thomas Newman]] provided the film's score.\\n\\nWhile ''The Shawshank Redemption'' received critical acclaim upon its release\\u2014particularly for its story, the performances of Robbins and Freeman, Newman's score, Darabont's direction and screenplay and [[Roger Deakins]]' cinematography\\u2014the film was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from the films ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' and ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', the general unpopularity of [[prison film]]s, its lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film's box-office gross to $73.3 million.\\n\\nOver 320,000 [[VHS]] rental copies were shipped throughout the United States, and on the strength of its award nominations and [[word of mouth]], it became one of the top [[video rentals]] of 1995. The broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock by [[Turner Broadcasting System]], and it was shown regularly on the [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. Decades after its release, the film is still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration or naming it a favorite in various surveys, leading to its recognition as one of the [[List of films considered the best|most \\\"beloved\\\" films ever made.]] In 2015, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\\".\\n\\n== Plot ==\\n<!-- IMPORTANT: As WP:FILMPLOT requires, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. Count as of 10/30/17 is 692 words -->\\nIn early 1947, [[Portland, Maine]], banker Andy Dufresne arrives at [[Shawshank State Prison]] to serve two [[Back-to-back life sentences|consecutive life sentences]] for murdering his wife and her lover. He is befriended by Ellis \\\"Red\\\" Redding, a [[contraband]] smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures a [[Geologist's hammer|rock hammer]] and a large poster of [[Rita Hayworth]] for Andy. Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently [[Prison rape|sexually assaulted]] by prison gang \\\"the Sisters\\\" and their leader, Bogs Diamond.\\n\\nIn 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being [[Estate tax in the United States|taxed on an inheritance]] and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats and cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to another prison; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, a [[Front organization|front]] to use Andy's financial expertise to manage financial matters for other prison staff, guards from other prisons, and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the [[Maine Legislature|state legislature]] requesting funds to improve the prison's decrepit library.\\n\\nBrooks is [[parole]]d in 1954 after serving 50 years, but he cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. The legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''; Andy plays [[Sull'aria ... che soave zeffiretto|an excerpt]] over the public address system and is punished with [[solitary confinement]]. After his release from solitary, Andy explains to a dismissive Red that hope is what gets him through his sentence. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving [[Kickback (bribery)|bribes]]. Andy [[money laundering|launders]] the money using the alias \\\"Randall Stephens\\\".\\n\\nIn 1965, Andy and Red befriend Tommy Williams, a young prisoner incarcerated for burglary. A year later, Andy helps him pass his [[General Educational Development]] (GED) exam. Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that his cellmate at another prison had claimed responsibility for the murders of which Andy was convicted. Andy brings the information to Norton who refuses to listen and, when Andy mentions the money laundering, sends Andy to solitary confinement and has Hadley fatally shoot Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue the money laundering, but Norton threatens to destroy the library, remove Andy's protection by the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and he tells a skeptical Red that he dreams of living in [[Zihuatanejo]], a Mexican town on the Pacific coast. Andy also tells him of a specific hayfield near [[Buxton, Maine|Buxton]], asking Red to promise, once he is released, to retrieve a package that Andy buried there. Red worries about Andy's mental well-being, especially when he learns Andy asked a fellow inmate for some rope.\\n\\nAt the next day's [[Roll call (policing)|roll call]], the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at a poster of [[Raquel Welch]] hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the past 19 years. The previous night, Andy used the rope to escape through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking Norton's suit, shoes, and [[ledger]], containing evidence of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens, withdraws over $370,000{{efn|The $370,000 Andy takes in 1966 is equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|370000|1966}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}}} of the laundered money from several banks, and mails the ledger and other evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.\\n\\nThe following year, Red is paroled after serving 40 years but struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole by traveling to [[Fort Hancock, Texas]], and crossing the border into Mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. He finds Andy sanding an old boat on a Zihuatanejo beach, and the two reunited friends happily embrace.\\n\\n==Cast==\\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\\n | direction = horizontal\\n | footer = [[Tim Robbins]] in 2012 (''left'') and [[Morgan Freeman]] in 2006\\n | image1 = TimRobbinsTIFFSept2012.jpg\\n | alt1 = A standing caucasian man with short white and grey hair, wears glasses and a blue coat: He faces left towards the camera smiling.\\n | image2 = Morgan Freeman, 2006 (cropped).jpg\\n | alt2 = An African American man with a beard and short hair, both a mix of white and grey, and wearing an earring in each ear: He is smiling towards the camera.\\n  }}\\n\\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Andy Dufresne: A banker sentenced to life in prison in 1947 for the murder of his wife and her lover<ref name=\\\"PhilosophyNow14\\\"/>\\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Ellis Boyd \\\"Red\\\" Redding: A prison contraband smuggler who befriends Andy<ref name=\\\"Cast\\\"/><ref name=\\\"RevEW\\\"/>\\n* [[Bob Gunton]] as Samuel Norton: The pious and cruel warden of Shawshank penitentiary<ref name=\\\"PhilosophyNow14\\\"/>\\n* [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] as Heywood: A member of Red's gang of long-serving convicts<ref name=\\\"Cast\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Comingsoon\\\"/>\\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as Byron Hadley: The brutal captain of the prison guards<ref name=\\\"Gizmodo\\\"/><ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/>\\n* [[Gil Bellows]] as Tommy Williams: A young convict imprisoned for burglary in 1965<ref name=\\\"Cast\\\"/>{{Sfn|TSR|1993|loc=1h20m32s}}\\n* [[James Whitmore]] as Brooks Hatlen: The elderly prison librarian, imprisoned at Shawshank for over five decades<ref name=\\\"Kennebeck\\\"/>\\n\\nThe cast also includes [[Mark Rolston]] as Bogs Diamond, the head of \\\"the Sisters\\\" gang and a prison rapist;<ref name=\\\"CastBogs\\\"/> [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] as the prosecuting attorney in Dufresne's trial; Alfonso Freeman as Fresh Fish Con; [[Ned Bellamy]] and [[Don McManus]] as, respectively, prison guards Youngblood and Wiley; and Dion Anderson as Head Bull Haig.<ref name=\\\"Cast\\\"/> Renee Blaine portrays Andy's wife, and Scott Mann portrays her golf-instructor lover Glenn Quentin.<ref name=\\\"CastMJ\\\"/> Frank Medrano plays Fat Ass, one of Andy's fellow new inmates who is beaten to death by Hadley,<ref name=\\\"Cast\\\"/>{{Sfn|TSR|1993|loc=16m42s\\u201419m05s}} and [[Bill Bolender]] plays Elmo Blatch, a convict who may actually be responsible for the crimes for which Andy is convicted.<ref name=\\\"Cineworld\\\"/> James Kisicki and Claire Slemmer portray the Maine National Bank manager and a teller, respectively.<ref name=\\\"Cleveland\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Cleveland3\\\"/>\\n\\n==Analysis==\\nThe film has been interpreted as being grounded in [[Christian mysticism]].{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=14}} Andy is offered as a messianic, [[Christ]]-like figure, with Red describing him early in the film as having an aura that engulfs and protects him from Shawshank.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=30}} The scene in which Andy and several inmates tar the prison roof can be seen as a recreation of the [[Last Supper]], with Andy obtaining beer/wine for the twelve inmates/disciples as Freeman describes them as the \\\"lords of all creation\\\" invoking Jesus' blessing.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|pp=31, 39}} Director Frank Darabont responded that this was not his deliberate intention,{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=31}} but he wanted people to find their own meaning in the film.<ref name=\\\"Empire1\\\"/> The discovery of ''The Marriage of Figaro'' record is described in the screenplay as akin to finding the [[Holy Grail]], bringing the prisoners to a halt, and causing the sick to rise up in their beds.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=39}}\\n\\nEarly in the film, Warden Norton quotes Jesus Christ to describe himself to Andy, saying, \\\"I am the light of the world\\\", declaring himself Andy's savior, but this description can also reference Lucifer, the bearer of light.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=48}} Indeed, the warden does not enforce the general rule of law, but chooses to enforce his own rules and punishments as he sees fit, becoming a law unto himself, like the behavior of Satan.<ref name=\\\"PhilosophyNow14\\\"/> The warden has also been compared to former United States President [[Richard Nixon]]. Norton's appearance and public addresses can be seen to mirror Nixon's. Similarly, Norton projects an image of a holy man, speaking down sanctimoniously to the servile masses while running corrupt scams, like those of which Nixon was accused.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=45}}\\n\\n[[File:Sand dunes at Shallow Inlet, Sandy Point - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An empty crescent shaped beach, with small patches of grass and a small red boat sits on the shore. The sea appears to the left of the image and mountains appear in the background.|Andy and Red's reunion was filmed at the [[Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge]], Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. The location has been interpreted as a form of escape or paradise.]]\\nZihuatanejo has been interpreted as an [[Analogue (literature)|analog]] for heaven or paradise.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=68}} In the film, Andy describes it as a place with no memory, offering absolution from his sins by forgetting about them or allowing them to be washed away by the Pacific Ocean, whose name means \\\"peaceful\\\". The possibility of escaping to Zihuatanejo is only raised after Andy admits that he feels responsible for his wife's death.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=68}} Similarly, Red's freedom is only earned once he accepts he cannot save himself or atone for his sins. Freeman has described Red's story as one of salvation as he is not innocent of his crimes, unlike Andy who finds redemption.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=80}} While some Christian viewers interpret Zihuatanejo as heaven, film critic [[Mark Kermode]] wrote that it can also be interpreted as a [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] form of guiltlessness achieved outside traditional notions of good and evil, where the amnesia offered is the destruction rather than forgiveness of sin, meaning Andy's aim is secular and atheistic. Just as Andy can be interpreted as a Christ-like figure, he can be seen as a [[Thus Spoke Zarathustra|Zarathustra]]-like prophet offering escape through education and the experience of freedom.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=68}} Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] argued that ''The Shawshank Redemption'' is an allegory for maintaining one's feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy's integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking.<ref name=\\\"RebertAnaly\\\"/>\\n\\nRobbins himself believes that the concept of Zihuatanejo resonates with audiences because it represents a form of escape that can be achieved after surviving for many years within whatever \\\"jail\\\" someone finds themselves in, whether a bad relationship, job, or environment. Robbins said that it is important that such a place exists for us.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=69}} Isaac M. Morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or imprisoned, even in freedom, based on their outlooks on life.<ref name=\\\"Moorhouse\\\"/> Philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] described freedom as an ongoing project that requires attention and resilience, without which a person begins to be defined by others or institutions, mirroring Red's belief that inmates become dependent on the prison to define their lives. Andy displays resilience through rebellion, by playing music over the prison loudspeaker, and refusing to continue with the money-laundering scam.<ref name=\\\"PhilosophyNow14\\\"/>\\n\\nMany elements can be considered as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film ''[[Gilda]]'' (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject that is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=37}} Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a [[film reel]] to help fight them off.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=41}} At the end of the film, Andy passes through a hole in his cell hidden by a movie poster to escape both his cell and ultimately Shawshank.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=38}}\\n\\nAndy and Red's relationship has been described as a nonsexual story between two men,<ref name=\\\"THR20\\\"/> that few other films offer, as the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=27}} Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy and Red's true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.<ref name=\\\"PhilosophyNow14\\\"/>\\n\\n==Production==\\n[[File:Frank Darabont at the PaleyFest 2011 - The Walking Dead panel.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=A caucasian, bald man wearing glasses and a dark shirt: He looks down at a book and pen held in his hands.|Director Frank Darabont (pictured in 2011) bought the adaptation rights to ''The Shawshank Redemption'' for $5,000 in 1987]]\\n\\n===Development===\\nDarabont first collaborated with author [[Stephen King]] in 1983 on the short film adaptation of \\\"[[The Woman in the Room]]\\\", buying the rights from him for $1\\u2014a [[Dollar Baby|Dollar Deal]] that King used to help new directors build a r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 by adapting his short stories.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> After receiving his first screenwriting credit in 1987 for ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'', Darabont returned to King with $5,000<ref name=\\\"Residuals\\\"/> to purchase the rights to adapt ''[[Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption]]'', a 96-page novella from King's 1982 collection ''[[Different Seasons]]'', written to explore genres other than the horror stories for which he was commonly known.<ref name=\\\"Variety20th\\\"/> Although King did not understand how the story, largely focused on Red contemplating his fellow prisoner Andy, could be turned into a feature film, Darabont believed it was \\\"obvious\\\".<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> King never cashed the $5,000 check from Darabont; he later framed it and returned it to Darabont accompanied by a note which read: \\\"In case you ever need bail money. Love, Steve.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Shortlist\\\"/>\\n\\nFive years later, Darabont wrote the script over an eight-week period. He expanded on elements of King's story. Brooks, who in the novella is a minor character who dies in a retirement home, became a tragic character who eventually hanged himself. Tommy, who in the novella trades his evidence exonerating Andy for transfer to a nicer prison, in the screenplay is murdered on the orders of Warden Norton, who is a composite of several warden characters in King's story.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> Darabont opted to create a single warden character to serve as the primary antagonist.<ref name=\\\"PotMGunton\\\"/> Among his inspirations, Darabont listed the works of director [[Frank Capra]], including ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939) and ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946), describing them as [[tall tale]]s; Darabont likened ''The Shawshank Redemption'' to a tall tale more than a prison movie.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=9}} He also cited ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990) as an inspiration on the use of dialogue to illustrate the passage of time in the script, and the prison drama ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' (1962) directed by [[John Frankenheimer]].<ref name=\\\"DB14\\\"/> While later scouting filming locations, Darabont happened upon Frankenheimer who was scouting for his own prison-set project ''[[Against the Wall (1994 film)|Against the Wall]]''. Darabont recalled that Frankenheimer took time out from his scouting to provide Darabont with encouragement and advice.<ref name=\\\"deadline dec2019\\\"/>\\n\\nAt the time, prison-based films were not considered likely box-office successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-[[Castle Rock Entertainment]] producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce ''The Shawshank Redemption''.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> Director and Castle Rock co-founder [[Rob Reiner]] also liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million<ref name=\\\"LATOct94\\\"/> and $3 million to allow him to direct it himself.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> Reiner, who had previously adapted King's 1982 novella ''[[The Body (King novella)|The Body]]'' into the 1986 film ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'', planned to cast [[Tom Cruise]] as Andy and [[Harrison Ford]] as Red.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/><ref name=\\\"MSNFacts\\\"/>\\n\\nCastle Rock offered to finance any other film Darabont wanted to develop. Darabont seriously considered the offer, citing growing up poor in Los Angeles, believing it would elevate his standing in the industry, and that Castle Rock could have contractually fired him and given the film to Reiner anyway, but he chose to remain the director, saying in a 2014 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' interview, \\\"you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for money and, you know, die without ever having done the thing you set out to do\\\".<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> Reiner served as Darabont's mentor on the project, instead.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> Within two weeks of showing the script to Castle Rock, Darabont had a $25 million budget to make his film<ref name=\\\"EWSep3094\\\"/> (taking a $750,000 screenwriting and directing salary plus a percentage of the net profits),<ref name=\\\"LATOct94\\\"/> and pre-production began in January 1993.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=9}}{{efn|The 1994 budget of $25{{nbsp}}million is equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|25000000|1994}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}.}}\\n\\n===Casting===\\n[[File:Clancy Brown by Gage Skidmore.jpg|upright|left|thumb|alt=A white man with a short white beard, and white and grey curly hair: He wears a white suit with a blue shirt.

To convince the studio that Gunton was right for the part, Darabont and producer [[Niki Marvin]] arranged for him to record a screen test on a day off from ''Demolition Man''. They had a wig made for him as his head was shaved for his ''Demolition Man'' role. Gunton wanted to portray Norton with hair as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed. Gunton performed his screen test with Robbins, which was filmed by Deakins. After being confirmed for the role, he used the wig in the film's early scenes until his hair regrew. Gunton said that Marvin and Darabont saw that he understood the character, which went in his favor, as did the fact his height was similar to Robbins', allowing Andy to believably use the warden's suit.<ref name=\\\"PotMGunton\\\"/>\\n\\nPortraying the head guard Byron Hadley, Clancy Brown was given the opportunity to speak with former guards by the production's liaison officer but declined, believing it would not be a good thing to say that his brutal character was in any way inspired by Ohio state correctional officers.{{Sfn|TRF|2001|loc=22:42}} William Sadler, who portrays Heywood, said that Darabont had approached him in 1989 on the set of the ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' television series, where he was a writer, about starring in the adaptation he was intending to make.<ref name=\\\"AVSadler\\\"/> Freeman's son Alfonso has a cameo as a young Red in [[mug shot]] photos,<ref name=\\\"DB14\\\"/> and as a prisoner shouting \\\"fresh fish\\\" as Andy arrives at Shawshank.<ref name=\\\"NYTExtras\\\"/> Among the extras used in the film were the former warden and former inmates of the reformatory, and active guards from a nearby incarceration facility.<ref name=\\\"EWSep3094\\\"/><ref name=\\\"LAWarden\\\"/> The novella's original title attracted several people to audition for the nonexistent role of Rita Hayworth, including a man in [[Drag queen|drag clothing]].<ref name=\\\"LATOct94\\\"/>\\n\\n===Filming===\\n[[File:Mansfield OH - Reformatory - Closed.jpg|thumb|alt=A grey stone building sits at the end of a green field.|[[Ohio State Reformatory]], also known as the Mansfield Reformatory, served as the fictional Shawshank prison]]\\nOn a $25 million budget,<ref name=\\\"BoxOffice\\\"/> [[principal photography]] took place over three months<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> between June and August 1993.<ref name=\\\"Variety1993\\\"/><ref name=\\\"avclub mansfield\\\"/> Filming regularly required up to 18-hour workdays, six days a week.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> Freeman described filming as tense, saying, \\\"Most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director. I remember having a bad moment with the director, had a few of those.\\\" Freeman referred to Darabont's requiring multiple takes of scenes, which he considered had no discernible differences. For example, the scene where Andy first approaches Red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film and featured Freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. The number of takes that were shot resulted in Freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. Freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes. Robbins said that the long days were difficult. Darabont felt that making the film taught him a lot, \\\"A director really needs to have an internal barometer to measure what any given actor needs.\\\"<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> He found his most frequent struggles were with Deakins. Darabont favored more scenic shots, while Deakins felt that not showing the outside of the prison added a sense of claustrophobia, and it meant that when a wide scenic shot was used, it had more impact.<ref name=\\\"EWSep3094\\\"/>\\n\\nMarvin spent five months scouting prisons across the United States and Canada, looking for a site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would entail.<ref name=\\\"LATIMES1993\\\"/> Marvin eventually chose the [[Ohio State Reformatory]] in [[Mansfield, Ohio]], to serve as the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone and brick buildings.<ref name=\\\"avclub mansfield\\\"/><ref name=\\\"LATIMES1993\\\"/> The facility had been shuttered three years earlier in 1990,<ref name=\\\"NPROnLoc\\\"/> due to inhumane living conditions.<ref name=\\\"avclub mansfield\\\"/>\\n\\nThe 15-acre reformatory, housing its own power plant and farm, was partially torn down shortly after filming was completed, leaving the main administration building and two cellblocks.<ref name=\\\"avclub mansfield\\\"/> Several of the interior shots of the specialized prison facilities, such as the admittance rooms and the warden's office, were shot in the reformatory. The interior of the boarding room used by Brooks and Red was in the administration building; exterior shots of the boarding house were taken elsewhere. Internal scenes in the prison cellblocks were filmed on a [[sound stage]] built inside a nearby shuttered [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric]] factory. Since Darabont wanted the inmates' cells to face each other, almost all the cellblock scenes were shot on a purpose-built [[Set construction|set]] housed in the Westinghouse factory,<ref name=\\\"avclub mansfield\\\"/> except for the scene featuring Elmo Blatch's admission of guilt for the crimes for which Andy was convicted.

He said that the time and precision taken by Deakins, and their limited filming schedule, meant he had to be precise in what he could film and how. In a 2019 interview, he stated that he regretted that this meant he could not film a close up of Robbins' face as he climbed down out of the hole from his cell.<ref name=\\\"ign darabont 2019\\\"/>\\n\\nAs for the scene where Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins' idea for Andy to turn the music up and not shut it off.<ref name=\\\"NYTExtras\\\"/> While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in ''Gilda'' (1946), they were originally intended to be watching [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''The Lost Weekend'' (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. As the footage was too costly to procure from [[Paramount Pictures]], producer Niki Marvin approached ''The Shawshank Redemption''{{'}}s domestic distribution rights-holder [[Columbia Pictures]], which offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which was ''Gilda''.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|pp=36\\u201337}} As filming took place mainly in and around the prison, scenes were often shot in near chronological order respective of the different eras depicted throughout the story.

Glotzer insisted on including the scene of Red and Andy reuniting in Zihuatanejo. She said Darabont felt this was a \\\"commercial, sappy\\\" ending, but Glotzer wanted the audience to see them together.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> Castle Rock agreed to finance filming for the scene without requiring its inclusion, guaranteeing Darabont the final decision.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=87}} The scene originally featured a longer reunion in which Andy and Red recited dialogue from their first meeting, but Darabont said it had a \\\"golly-gee-ain't-we-cute\\\" quality and excised it.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=86}} The beach reunion was test audiences' favorite scene; both Freeman and Robbins felt it provided the necessary closure.

He felt that it already elicited such strong emotions without music that he found it difficult to compose one that would elevate scenes without distracting from them. The piece, \\\"Shawshank Redemption\\\", plays during Andy's escape from Shawshank and originally had a three-note motif, but Darabont felt it had too much of a \\\"triumphal flourish\\\" and asked that it be toned down to a single-note motif. \\\"So Was Red\\\", played following Red's release from prison, and leading to his discovery of Andy's cache, became one of Newman's favorite pieces. The piece was initially written for a solo oboe, until Newman reluctantly agreed to add harmonica\\u2014a reference to the harmonica Red receives from Andy to continue his message of hope. According to Darabont, harmonica player [[Tommy Morgan]] \\\"casually delivered something dead-on perfect on the first take\\\", and this is heard in the finished film.<ref name=\\\"WSJMusic\\\"/> Newman's score was so successful that excerpts from it were used in movie trailers for years afterwards.<ref name=\\\"Variety20th\\\"/>\\n\\n==Release==\\n===Theatrical===\\nLeading up to its release, the film was [[Test screening|test screened]] with the public.

Following a Hollywood tradition of visiting different theaters on opening night to see the audiences view their film live, Darabont and Glotzer went to the [[Cinerama Dome]], but found no one there. Glotzer claimed that the pair actually sold two tickets outside the theater with the promise that if the buyers did not like the film, they could ask Castle Rock for a refund.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> While critics praised the film, Glotzer believed that a lackluster review from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' pushed crowds away.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/><ref name=\\\"BFI2017\\\"/> It received a wide release on October 14, 1994, expanding to a total of 944 theaters to earn $2.4 million\\u2014an average of $2,545 per theater\\u2014finishing as the number-nine film of the weekend, behind sex-comedy ''[[Exit to Eden (film)|Exit to Eden]]'' ($3 million), and just ahead of the historical drama ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' ($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the cinemas.<ref name=\\\"Variety20th\\\"/><ref name=\\\"BoxOffice\\\"/> ''The Shawshank Redemption'' closed in late November 1994, after 10 weeks with an approximate total gross of $16 million.<ref name=\\\"Bomweekends\\\"/> It was considered a [[box-office bomb]], failing to recoup its $25 million budget, not including marketing costs and the cinema exhibitors' cuts.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/>\\n\\nThe film was also competing with ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' ($108 million),<ref name=\\\"Residuals\\\"/> which also premiered October 14 following its [[Palme d'Or]] award win, and ''Forrest Gump'' ($330 million),<ref name=\\\"Residuals\\\"/> which was in the middle of a successful 42-week theatrical run.<ref name=\\\"BFI2017\\\"/> Both films would become quotable cultural phenomena.

      "\\n<!-- IMPORTANT: As WP:FILMPLOT requires, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. Count as of 10/30/17 is 692 words -->\\nIn early 1947, [[Portland, Maine]], banker Andy Dufresne arrives at [[Shawshank State Prison]] to serve two [[Back-to-back life sentences|consecutive life sentences]] for murdering his wife and her lover. He is befriended by Ellis \\\"Red\\\" Redding, a [[contraband]] smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures a [[Geologist's hammer|rock hammer]] and a large poster of [[Rita Hayworth]] for Andy. Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently [[Prison rape|sexually assaulted]] by prison gang \\\"the Sisters\\\" and their leader, Bogs Diamond.\\n\\nIn 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being [[Estate tax in the United States|taxed on an inheritance]] and offers to help him shelter the money legally.

The film tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is Life imprisonment|sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis \\\"Red\\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles.\\n\\nDarabont purchased the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce ''The Shawshank Redemption'', which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars for the role of Andy, including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman provided the film's score.\\n\\nWhile ''The Shawshank Redemption'' received critical acclaim upon its release\\u2014particularly for its story, the performances of Robbins and Freeman, Newman's score, Darabont's direction and screenplay and Roger Deakins' cinematography\\u2014the film was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from the films ''Pulp Fiction'' and ''Forrest Gump'', the general unpopularity of prison films, its lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven Academy Awards|Academy Award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film's box-office gross to $73.3 million.\\n\\nOver 320,000 VHS rental copies were shipped throughout the United States, and on the strength of its award nominations and word of mouth, it became one of the top video rentals of 1995. The broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock by Turner Broadcasting System, and it was shown regularly on the TNT (American TV network)|TNT network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. Decades after its release, the film is still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration or naming it a favorite in various surveys, leading to its recognition as one of the List of films considered the best|most \\\"beloved\\\" films ever made. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\\".\\n\\n== Plot ==\\n\\nIn early 1947, Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne arrives at Shawshank State Prison to serve two Back-to-back life sentences|consecutive life sentences for murdering his wife and her lover. He is befriended by Ellis \\\"Red\\\" Redding, a contraband smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures a Geologist's hammer|rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently Prison rape|sexually assaulted by prison gang \\\"the Sisters\\\" and their leader, Bogs Diamond.\\n\\nIn 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being Estate tax in the United States|taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats and cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to another prison; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, a Front organization|front to use Andy's financial expertise to manage financial matters for other prison staff, guards from other prisons, and the warden himself.

After his release from solitary, Andy explains to a dismissive Red that hope is what gets him through his sentence. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving Kickback (bribery)|bribes. Andy money laundering|launders the money using the alias \\\"Randall Stephens\\\".\\n\\nIn 1965, Andy and Red befriend Tommy Williams, a young prisoner incarcerated for burglary. A year later, Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (GED) exam. Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that his cellmate at another prison had claimed responsibility for the murders of which Andy was convicted.

Norton's appearance and public addresses can be seen to mirror Nixon's. Similarly, Norton projects an image of a holy man, speaking down sanctimoniously to the servile masses while running corrupt scams, like those of which Nixon was accused.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=45}}\\n\\nFile:Sand dunes at Shallow Inlet, Sandy Point - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An empty crescent shaped beach, with small patches of grass and a small red boat sits on the shore. The sea appears to the left of the image and mountains appear in the background.|Andy and Red's reunion was filmed at the [[Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge, Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. The location has been interpreted as a form of escape or paradise.]]\\nZihuatanejo has been interpreted as an Analogue (literature)|analog for heaven or paradise.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=68}} In the film, Andy describes it as a place with no memory, offering absolution from his sins by forgetting about them or allowing them to be washed away by the Pacific Ocean, whose name means \\\"peaceful\\\". The possibility of escaping to Zihuatanejo is only raised after Andy admits that he feels responsible for his wife's death.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=68}} Similarly, Red's freedom is only earned once he accepts he cannot save himself or atone for his sins. Freeman has described Red's story as one of salvation as he is not innocent of his crimes, unlike Andy who finds redemption.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=80}} While some Christian viewers interpret Zihuatanejo as heaven, film critic Mark Kermode wrote that it can also be interpreted as a Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean form of guiltlessness achieved outside traditional notions of good and evil, where the amnesia offered is the destruction rather than forgiveness of sin, meaning Andy's aim is secular and atheistic. Just as Andy can be interpreted as a Christ-like figure, he can be seen as a Thus Spoke Zarathustra|Zarathustra-like prophet offering escape through education and the experience of freedom.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=68}} Film critic Roger Ebert argued that ''The Shawshank Redemption'' is an allegory for maintaining one's feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy's integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking.<ref name=\\\"RebertAnaly\\\"/>\\n\\nRobbins himself believes that the concept of Zihuatanejo resonates with audiences because it represents a form of escape that can be achieved after surviving for many years within whatever \\\"jail\\\" someone finds themselves in, whether a bad relationship, job, or environment. Robbins said that it is important that such a place exists for us.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=69}} Isaac M. Morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or imprisoned, even in freedom, based on their outlooks on life.<ref name=\\\"Moorhouse\\\"/> Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described freedom as an ongoing project that requires attention and resilience, without which a person begins to be defined by others or institutions, mirroring Red's belief that inmates become dependent on the prison to define their lives. Andy displays resilience through rebellion, by playing music over the prison loudspeaker, and refusing to continue with the money-laundering scam.<ref name=\\\"PhilosophyNow14\\\"/>\\n\\nMany elements can be considered as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film ''Gilda'' (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature ''The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend'' (1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject that is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=37}} Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a film reel to help fight them off.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=41}} At the end of the film, Andy passes through a hole in his cell hidden by a movie poster to escape both his cell and ultimately Shawshank.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=38}}\\n\\nAndy and Red's relationship has been described as a nonsexual story between two men,<ref name=\\\"THR20\\\"/> that few other films offer, as the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=27}} Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy and Red's true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.<ref name=\\\"PhilosophyNow14\\\"/>\\n\\n==Production==\\nFile:Frank Darabont at the PaleyFest 2011 - The Walking Dead panel.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=A caucasian, bald man wearing glasses and a dark shirt: He looks down at a book and pen held in his hands.|Director Frank Darabont (pictured in 2011) bought the adaptation rights to ''The Shawshank Redemption'' for $5,000 in 1987\\n\\n===Development===\\nDarabont first collaborated with author Stephen King in 1983 on the short film adaptation of \\\"The Woman in the Room\\\", buying the rights from him for $1\\u2014a Dollar Baby|Dollar Deal that King used to help new directors build a r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 by adapting his short stories.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> After receiving his first screenwriting credit in 1987 for ''A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors'', Darabont returned to King with $5,000<ref name=\\\"Residuals\\\"/> to purchase the rights to adapt ''Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'', a 96-page novella from King's 1982 collection ''Different Seasons'', written to explore genres other than the horror stories for which he was commonly known.<ref name=\\\"Variety20th\\\"/> Although King did not understand how the story, largely focused on Red contemplating his fellow prisoner Andy, could be turned into a feature film, Darabont believed it was \\\"obvious\\\".<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> King never cashed the $5,000 check from Darabont; he later framed it and returned it to Darabont accompanied by a note which read: \\\"In case you ever need bail money. Love, Steve.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Shortlist\\\"/>\\n\\nFive years later, Darabont wrote the script over an eight-week period. He expanded on elements of King's story. Brooks, who in the novella is a minor character who dies in a retirement home, became a tragic character who eventually hanged himself. Tommy, who in the novella trades his evidence exonerating Andy for transfer to a nicer prison, in the screenplay is murdered on the orders of Warden Norton, who is a composite of several warden characters in King's story.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> Darabont opted to create a single warden character to serve as the primary antagonist.<ref name=\\\"PotMGunton\\\"/> Among his inspirations, Darabont listed the works of director Frank Capra, including ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' (1939) and ''It's a Wonderful Life'' (1946), describing them as tall tales; Darabont likened ''The Shawshank Redemption'' to a tall tale more than a prison movie.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=9}} He also cited ''Goodfellas'' (1990) as an inspiration on the use of dialogue to illustrate the passage of time in the script, and the prison drama ''Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz'' (1962) directed by John Frankenheimer.<ref name=\\\"DB14\\\"/> While later scouting filming locations, Darabont happened upon Frankenheimer who was scouting for his own prison-set project ''Against the Wall (1994 film)|Against the Wall''. Darabont recalled that Frankenheimer took time out from his scouting to provide Darabont with encouragement and advice.<ref name=\\\"deadline dec2019\\\"/>\\n\\nAt the time, prison-based films were not considered likely box-office successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce ''The Shawshank Redemption''.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> Director and Castle Rock co-founder Rob Reiner also liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million<ref name=\\\"LATOct94\\\"/> and $3 million to allow him to direct it himself.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> Reiner, who had previously adapted King's 1982 novella ''The Body (King novella)|The Body'' into the 1986 film ''Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me'', planned to cast Tom Cruise as Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/><ref name=\\\"MSNFacts\\\"/>\\n\\nCastle Rock offered to finance any other film Darabont wanted to develop. Darabont seriously considered the offer, citing growing up poor in Los Angeles, believing it would elevate his standing in the industry, and that Castle Rock could have contractually fired him and given the film to Reiner anyway, but he chose to remain the director, saying in a 2014 ''Variety (magazine)|Variety'' interview, \\\"you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for money and, you know, die without ever having done the thing you set out to do\\\".<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> Reiner served as Darabont's mentor on the project, instead.<ref name=\\\"vanityfair\\\"/> Within two weeks of showing the script to Castle Rock, Darabont had a $25 million budget to make his film<ref name=\\\"EWSep3094\\\"/> (taking a $750,000 screenwriting and directing salary plus a percentage of the net profits),<ref name=\\\"LATOct94\\\"/> and pre-production began in January 1993.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=9}}{{efn|The 1994 budget of $25{{nbsp}}million is equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|25000000|1994}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}.}}\\n\\n===Casting===\\nFile:Clancy Brown by Gage Skidmore.jpg|upright|left|thumb|alt=A white man with a short white beard, and white and grey curly hair: He wears a white suit with a blue shirt.

Gunton wanted to portray Norton with hair as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed.

For example, the scene where Andy first approaches Red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film and featured Freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. The number of takes that were shot resulted in Freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. Freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes.

      "Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino from a story he conceived with Roger Avary. It tells four intertwining tales of crime and violence in Los Angeles, California. The film stars John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.\n",
      "Tarantino wrote Pulp Fiction in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for True Romance (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of \"pulp\". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence. TriStar Pictures reportedly turned down the script as \"too demented\". Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax fully financed.\n",
      "Pulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 67th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Original Screenplay; it earned Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman Academy Award nominations and boosted their careers. Its development, marketing, distribution, and profitability had a sweeping effect on independent cinema.\n",
      "Pulp Fiction is widely regarded as Tarantino's magnum opus, with particular praise for its screenwriting. The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film. It is often considered a cultural watershed, influencing films and other media that adopted elements of its style. The cast was also widely praised, with Travolta, Thurman, and Jackson earning particular acclaim. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it the best film since 1983 and it has appeared on many critics' lists of the greatest films ever made. In 2013, Pulp Fiction was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n",

      "Pulp Fiction's narrative is told out of chronological order and follows three main interrelated stories that each have a different protagonist: Vincent Vega, a hitman; Butch Coolidge, a prizefighter; and Jules Winnfield, Vincent's business partner.The film begins with a diner hold-up staged by a couple, then begins to shift from one storyline to another before returning to the diner for the conclusion. There are seven narrative sequences; the three primary storylines are preceded by intertitles:\n",

      "\"Epilogue – The Diner\" (ii)If the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5. Sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. According to Philip Parker, the structural form is \"an episodic narrative with circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the narrative\". Other analysts describe the structure as a \"circular narrative\".\n",

      "=== Summary ===\n",
      "Hitmen Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett's associates. He declaims a passage from the Bible, and he and Vincent kill Brett for trying to double-cross Marsellus.\n",
      "Another man bursts out of the bathroom and fires at them, but every shot misses; after briefly checking themselves for wounds, Jules and Vincent shoot him dead. While driving away with Brett's associate Marvin, Jules professes that their survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes. Vincent accidentally fatally shoots Marvin in the face, and covering Vincent, Jules, and the car interior in blood in broad daylight. They hide the car at the home of Jules's friend Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife, Bonnie, comes home. Marsellus sends a cleaner, Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to clean the car, hide the body in the trunk, dispose of their bloody clothes, and take the car to a junkyard.\n",
      "At a diner, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their \"miraculous\" survival at the apartment was a sign of divine intervention. While Vincent is in the bathroom, a couple, \"Pumpkin\" and \"Honey Bunny\", hold up the restaurant and demand Marsellus's briefcase. Jules distracts Pumpkin with its contents, and then overpowers him and holds him at gunpoint; Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and points her gun at Jules. Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her, but Jules defuses the situation. He recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase in hand. They take the briefcase to Marsellus and wait while he bribes boxer Butch Coolidge to take a dive in his upcoming match.\n",
      "The next day, Vincent purchases heroin from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up and drives to meet Marsellus's trophy wife, Mia, having agreed to escort her while Marsellus is out of town. They eat at Jack Rabbit Slim's, a 1950s-themed restaurant, and participate in a twist contest, then return home. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin and snorts it, mistaking it for cocaine. She suffers an overdose; Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where they revive her with an injection of adrenaline into her heart. Vincent drops Mia off at her home, and the two agree never to tell Marsellus about the incident.\n",
      "Butch bets the bribe money on himself and double-crosses Marsellus, winning the bout but accidentally killing his opponent as well. Knowing that Marsellus will send hitmen after him, he prepares to flee with his girlfriend, Fabienne, but discovers she has forgotten to pack a gold watch passed down to him through his family. Returning to his apartment to retrieve it, he notices a gun on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. When Vincent exits the bathroom, Butch shoots him dead and departs.\n",
      "When Marsellus spots Butch stopped at a traffic light, Butch rams his car into him, then gets hit by an oncoming vehicle, leaving both of them injured and dazed. Once Marsellus regains consciousness, he shoots at Butch, chasing him into a pawnshop. Butch gains the upper hand and is about to shoot Marsellus, but the shop owner, Maynard, captures them at gunpoint and binds and gags them in the basement. Maynard and his accomplice Zed take Marsellus into another room and begin to rape him, leaving the \"gimp\" – a silent figure in a bondage suit – to watch over Butch. Butch breaks loose and knocks the gimp unconscious. Instead of fleeing, he decides to save Marsellus, and arms himself with a katana from the pawnshop. He kills Maynard and frees Marsellus, who shoots Zed in the crotch with Maynard's shotgun. Marsellus informs Butch that they are even, and to tell no one about the rape and to depart Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's motorcycle, and they ride away.\n",

      "== Cast ==\n",
      "John Travolta as Vincent Vega:Jules' partner-in-crime, working for Marsellus Wallace. Tarantino cast Travolta in Pulp Fiction because Michael Madsen, who had played Vic Vega in Reservoir Dogs, chose to appear in Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp instead. Madsen has since expressed regret over his decision. Harvey Weinstein pushed for Daniel Day-Lewis in the part. Travolta accepted a reduced rate; sources say either US$100,000 or US$140,000. The film's success and his Academy Award nomination for Best Actor revitalized his career. Vincent is the brother of Vic Vega, also known as Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs (1992), and in 2004, Tarantino discussed an idea for a movie starring Travolta and Madsen as the \"Vega Brothers\"; the concept remains unrealized.Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield:Vincent's partner in crime, working for Marsellus Wallace. Jackson's first audition was overshadowed by Paul Calderón; Jackson had assumed the audition was merely a reading. Weinstein convinced him to audition a second time and his performance of the final diner scene won over Tarantino. Jules was originally scripted with a giant afro, but Tarantino's PA mistakenly bought a Jheri curled wig. Tarantino was enraged but Jackson persuaded him to keep it since the hairstyle had gained popularity through the rap group N.W.A. Film critic Owen Gleiberman took it as a \"tacit comic statement about the ghettoization of [Black people] in movies\". Jackson received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Calderón appears in the film as Paul, a bartender at Marsellus's social club, as well as Marsellus's assistant. Tarantino wrote the role for Laurence Fishburne, who turned it down. According to Tarantino, Fishburne refused it because his team did not see it as a starring role; Fishburne later said he turned it down because he felt the film glamorized heroin.Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace:Wallace's wife and an aspiring actress. Miramax favored Holly Hunter or Meg Ryan for the role of Mia. Alfre Woodard and Meg Tilly were also considered but Tarantino wanted Thurman after their first meeting. She dominated the film's promotional material, appearing on a bed with cigarette in hand. She was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Despite being launched into the celebrity A-list, Thurman chose not to do any big-budget films until Batman & Robin (1997) three years later.Harvey Keitel as Winston Wolfe:A \"cleaner\" who aids Jules and Vincent. Tarantino wrote the part of Wolfe for Keitel, who had starred in Reservoir Dogs and was instrumental in its production. In Tarantino's words, \"Harvey had been my favorite actor since I was 16 years old.\" Keitel had played a similarly employed character in Point of No Return (1993).Tim Roth as Ringo/\"Pumpkin\":A burglar and Yolanda's boyfriend. Roth had starred in Reservoir Dogs alongside Keitel. He had used an American accent in Reservoir Dogs but used his natural, London accent in Pulp Fiction. Though Tarantino had written the part with Roth in mind, TriStar head Mike Medavoy preferred Johnny Depp or Christian Slater. Early in development, Tarantino had contemplated casting Roth as Vincent and Gary Oldman as Jules, rewriting the characters as \"two English guys\".Amanda Plummer as Yolanda/\"Honey Bunny\":Ringo's girlfriend and partner in crime. Tarantino wrote the role of Yolanda for Plummer to partner her with Roth. Roth had introduced Tarantino to her, saying: \"I want to work with Amanda in one of your films but she has to have a really big gun.\"Maria de Medeiros as Fabienne:Butch's girlfriend. Tarantino met de Medeiros, a Portuguese actress, while traveling with Reservoir Dogs around the European film festival circuit.Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace:A crime boss and employer of Jules and Vincent. Before Rhames was cast, the part of Wallace was initially offered to Max Julien and Sid Haig, but both turned down the role. According to Bender, Rhames gave \"one of the best auditions I've ever seen\". His acclaimed performance led to him being cast in big-budget features such as Mission Impossible (1996), Con Air (1997) and Out of Sight (1998).Eric Stoltz as Lance:Vincent's drug dealer. Gary Oldman was the preferred choice among TriStar executives, based on his portrayal of drug-dealing pimp Drexl Spivey in True Romance (1993).Rosanna Arquette as Jody:Lance's wife. Pam Grier read for the role, but Tarantino did not believe audiences would find it plausible for Lance to yell at her. Tarantino later cast Grier as the lead role for Jackie Brown. Ellen DeGeneres also read for the part of Jody. Rosanna's sister Alexis (then known as Robert Arquette) also appears in the film, as a man emerging from a bathroom to shoot at and miss Vincent and Jules who then kill him.Christopher Walken as Captain Koons:A USAF veteran of the Vietnam War who delivers a young Butch his father's coveted gold watch. During Koons' monologue, which is interspersed with colorful descriptions of the Viet Cong, he mentions a soldier called \"Winocki\". Joe Winocki (John Garfield) is a character in the 1943 film Air Force directed by Howard Hawks, one of Tarantino's favorite directors. Tarantino played a character named Desmond Winocki in a guest appearance on an episode of All-American Girl titled Pulp Sitcom.Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge:An aging boxer on the run from Marsellus having double-crossed him. Willis was already a star but most of his recent films had been critical and box-office disappointments. As related by Peter Bart, participating in the modestly budgeted film \"meant lowering his salary and risking his star status but the strategy ... paid off royally: Pulp Fiction not only brought Willis new respect as an actor but also earned him several million dollars\". Willis' appearance and physical presence were crucial to Tarantino, \"Bruce has the look of a 50s actor. I can't think of any other star that has that look\". Butch's look was modeled on Aldo Ray in Nightfall and his demeanor based on Ralph Meeker's portrayal of Mike Hammer in Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly. Chandler Lindauer plays a young Butch.Bronagh Gallagher plays Jody's friend Trudi who does little but smoke a bong during the scene where Vincent revives Mia. According to author Jason Bailey, \"Quentin thought it would be funny to have this casual observer who just happened to be there. All of this was born out of the experience of, when you go to someone's house to buy drugs, there are always people who are just there\". Phil LaMarr portrays Marvin, an associate of Jules and Vincent. LaMarr auditioned for Tarantino after both had done a show for an improv group a few months prior. He read for the roles of Jules Winnfield and Brett before being cast as Marvin. Tarantino appears as Jules' friend Jimmie, in whose house they clean up a murder. Tarantino was unsure whether to play Jimmie or Lance, choosing Jimmie as he wanted to be behind the camera during Mia's overdose scene.Frank Whaley portrays Brett, who has a briefcase requested by Marcellus. Whaley met Tarantino while he was filming Reservoir Dogs at a lab in Sundance Institute. He recalls, \"we ended up meeting and spending time together, and I liked him, so I was really happy when he asked me to be in this movie.\" Burr Steers appears as Roger, a friend of Brett's nicknamed \"Flock of Seagulls\" by Jules. The scene of the confrontation between Brett and Jules went through several takes due to Steers making mistakes. Steers recalled in an interview that he had found acting difficult due to the loudness of the gunshots.Angela Jones portrays Esmeralda Villalobos, a cab driver who aids Butch's escape. Her casting and character were inspired by her performance in the 1991 short film Curdled, later remade as a 1996 feature film with finance from Tarantino and again starring Jones. Duane Whitaker, Peter Greene and Stephen Hibbert play Maynard, Zed and the gimp. According to The Daily Beast, these \"three psycho hillbillies\" that rape Marsellus in Maynard's shop's basement allude to the film Deliverance. Steve Buscemi makes a cameo appearance as a waiter at Jack Rabbit Slim's, dressed as Buddy Holly. Buscemi, who had appeared in Reservoir Dogs, was originally considered for the role of Jimmie but was unable to commit. Kathy Griffin appears as herself. Michael Gilden and Joseph Pilato also appear at Jack Rabbit Slim's as waiter Phillip Morris Page and a Dean Martin impersonator, respectively. Emil Sitka made a cameo via posthumous archive footage, Karen Maruyama appears as \"Gawker #1\" after Butch's car accident, and Julia Sweeney portrays Raquel, the daughter of the owner of the junkyard in which Marvin's body is disposed of. Producer Lawrence Bender makes a cameo as a victim of the diner robbery, credited as \"Long Hair Yuppie-Scum\". Jerome Patrick Hoban appears in the Jack Rabbit Slim's segment as an Ed Sullivan impersonator. Susan Griffiths appears alongside Hoban as a Marilyn Monroe impersonator.\n",

      "== Production ==\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Writing ===\n",
      "Roger Avary wrote the first element of what would become the Pulp Fiction screenplay in the fall of 1990:\n",
      "\n",
      "Tarantino and Avary decided to write a short, on the theory that it would be easier to get made than a feature. But they quickly realized that nobody produces shorts, so the film became a trilogy, with one section by Tarantino, one by Avary, and one by a third director who never materialized. Each eventually expanded his section into a feature-length script.\n",
      "The initial inspiration was the three-part horror anthology film Black Sabbath (1963), by Italian filmmaker Mario Bava. The Tarantino–Avary project was provisionally titled \"Black Mask\", after the seminal hardboiled crime fiction magazine. Tarantino's script was produced as Reservoir Dogs, his directorial debut; Avary created the basis for the \"Gold Watch\" storyline of Pulp Fiction.With work on Reservoir Dogs completed, Tarantino returned to the notion of a trilogy film: \"I got the idea of doing something that novelists get a chance to do but filmmakers don't: telling three separate stories, having characters float in and out with different weights depending on the story.\" Tarantino explains that the idea \"was basically to take like the oldest chestnuts that you've ever seen when it comes to crime stories – the oldest stories in the book ... You know, 'Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife' – the oldest story about ... the guy's gotta go out with the big man's wife and don't touch her. You know, you've seen the story a zillion times.\" \"I'm using old forms of storytelling and then purposely having them run awry\", he says. \"Part of the trick is to take these movie characters, these genre characters and these genre situations and actually apply them to some of real life's rules and see how they unravel.\" In at least one case, boxer Butch Coolidge, Tarantino had in mind a specific character from a classic Hollywood crime story: \"I wanted him to be basically like Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer in Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly [1955]. I wanted him to be a bully and a jerk\".Tarantino went to work on the script for Pulp Fiction in Amsterdam in March 1992, possibly at the Winston Hotel in the Red Light District. He was joined there by Avary, who contributed \"Pandemonium Reigns\" to the project and participated in its rewriting as well as the development of the new storylines that would link up with it. Two scenes originally written by Avary for the True Romance screenplay, exclusively credited to Tarantino, were incorporated into the opening of \"The Bonnie Situation\": the \"miraculous\" missed shots by the hidden gunman and the rear seat automobile killing. The notion of the crimeworld \"cleaner\" that became the heart of the episode was inspired by a short, Curdled, that Tarantino saw at a film festival. He cast the lead actress, Angela Jones, in Pulp Fiction and later backed the filmmakers' production of a feature-length version of Curdled. The script included a couple of made-up commercial brands that often featured in later Tarantino films: Big Kahuna burgers (a Big Kahuna soda cup appears in Reservoir Dogs) and Red Apple cigarettes. As he worked on the script, Tarantino also accompanied Reservoir Dogs around the European film festivals. Released in the United States in October 1992, the picture was a critical and commercial success. In January 1993, the Pulp Fiction script was complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Financing ===\n",
      "Tarantino and his producer, Lawrence Bender, brought the script to Jersey Films. Before even seeing Reservoir Dogs, Jersey had attempted to sign Tarantino for his next project. Ultimately a development deal worth around $1 million had been struck: The deal gave A Band Apart, Bender and Tarantino's newly formed production company, initial financing and office facilities; Jersey got a share of the project and the right to shop the script to a studio. Jersey had a distribution and \"first look\" deal with Columbia TriStar, which paid Tarantino for the right to consider exercising its option. In February, Pulp Fiction appeared on a Variety list of films in pre-production at TriStar. In June, however, the studio put the script into turnaround. According to a studio executive, TriStar chief Mike Medavoy found it \"too demented\". There were suggestions that TriStar was resistant to back a film featuring a heroin user; there were also indications that the studio simply saw the project as too low-budget for its desired star-driven image. Avary – who was about to start shooting his own directorial debut, Killing Zoe – has said that TriStar's objections were comprehensive, encompassing the script's fundamental structure. He characterizes the studio's position: \"'This is the worst thing ever written. It makes no sense. Someone's dead and then they're alive. It's too long, violent, and unfilmable.' ... So I thought, 'That's that!'\"Bender brought the script to Miramax, the formerly independent studio that had recently been acquired by Disney. Harvey Weinstein – co-chairman of Miramax, along with his brother Bob – was instantly enthralled by the script and the company picked it up. Pulp Fiction, the first Miramax project to get a green light after the Disney acquisition, was budgeted at $8.5 million. It became the first movie that Miramax completely financed. Helping hold costs down was the plan Bender executed to pay all the main actors the same amount per week, regardless of their industry status. The New York Times reported, \"Most of the actors received relatively small salaries along with a percentage of the profits.\" The biggest star to sign on to the project was Bruce Willis. Though he had recently appeared in several big-budget flops, he was still a major overseas draw. On the strength of his name, Miramax garnered $11 million for the film's worldwide rights, virtually ensuring its profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Filming ===\n",
      "Principal photography commenced on September 20, 1993. The lead offscreen talent had all worked with Tarantino on Reservoir Dogs – cinematographer Andrzej Sekuła, film editor Sally Menke, production designer David Wasco, and costume designer Betsy Heimann. According to Tarantino, \"[W]e had $8 million. I wanted it to look like a $20–25 million movie. I wanted it to look like an epic. It's an epic in everything – in invention, in ambition, in length, in scope, in everything except the price tag.\" The film, he says, was shot \"on 50 ASA film stock, which is the slowest stock they make. The reason we use it is that it creates an almost no-grain image, it's lustrous. It's the closest thing we have to 50s Technicolor.\" The largest chunk of the budget – $150,000 – went to creating the Jack Rabbit Slim's set.  It was built in a Culver City warehouse, where it was joined by several other sets, as well as the film's production offices. The diner sequence was shot on location in Hawthorne at the Hawthorne Grill, known for its Googie architecture. For the costumes, Tarantino took his inspiration from French director Jean-Pierre Melville, who believed that the clothes his characters wore were their symbolic suits of armor. Tarantino cast himself in a modest-sized role as he had in Reservoir Dogs. One of his pop totems, Fruit Brute, a long-discontinued General Mills cereal, also returned from the earlier film. The shoot wrapped on November 30. Before Pulp Fiction's premiere, Tarantino convinced Avary to forfeit his agreed-on cowriting credit and accept a \"story by\" credit, so the line \"Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino\" could be used in advertising and onscreen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Music ==\n",
      "\n",
      "No film score was composed for Pulp Fiction; Quentin Tarantino instead used an eclectic assortment of surf music, rock and roll, soul, and pop songs. Dick Dale's rendition of \"Misirlou\" plays during the opening credits. Tarantino chose surf music as the basic musical style for the film, but not, he insists, because of its association with surfing culture: \"To me it just sounds like rock and roll, even Morricone music. It sounds like rock and roll spaghetti Western music.\" Tarantino planned to use a power pop song, \"My Sharona\" by The Knack, during the film's rape scene, but ultimately discounted it.Some of the songs were suggested to Tarantino by his friends Chuck Kelley and Laura Lovelace, who were credited as music consultants. Lovelace also appeared in the film as Laura, a waitress; she reprises the role in Jackie Brown. The soundtrack album was released along with the film in 1994. The album peaked on the Billboard 200 chart at number 21. The single, Urge Overkill's cover of the Neil Diamond song \"Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon\", reached number 59.Estella Tincknell describes how the particular combination of well-known and obscure recordings helps establish the film as a \"self-consciously 'cool' text. [The] use of the mono-tracked, beat-heavy style of early 1960s U.S. 'underground' pop mixed with 'classic' ballads such as Dusty Springfield's 'Son of a Preacher Man' is crucial to the film's postmodern knowingness.\" She contrasts the soundtrack with that of Forrest Gump, the highest-grossing film of 1994, which also relies on period pop recordings: \"[T]he version of 'the sixties' offered by Pulp Fiction ... is certainly not that of the publicly recognized counter-culture featured in Forrest Gump, but is, rather, a more genuinely marginal form of sub-culture based around a lifestyle – surfing, 'hanging' – that is resolutely apolitical.\" The soundtrack is central, she says, to the film's engagement with the \"younger, cinematically knowledgeable spectator\" it solicits.\n",

      "Pulp Fiction premiered in May 1994 at the Cannes Film Festival. The Weinsteins \"hit the beach like commandos\", bringing the picture's entire cast over. The film was unveiled at a midnight hour screening and caused a sensation It won the Palme d'Or, the festival's top prize, generating a further wave of publicity.The first U.S. review of the film was published on May 23 in industry trade magazine Variety. Todd McCarthy called Pulp Fiction a \"spectacularly entertaining piece of pop culture ... a startling, massive success.\" From Cannes forward, Tarantino was on the road continuously, promoting the film. Over the next few months it played in smaller festivals around Europe, building buzz: Nottingham, Munich, Taormina, Locarno, Norway, and San Sebastián. Tarantino later said, \"One thing that's cool is that by breaking up the linear structure, when I watch the film with an audience, it does break [the audience's] alpha state. It's like, all of a sudden, 'I gotta watch this ... I gotta pay attention.' You can almost feel everybody moving in their seats. It's actually fun to watch an audience in some ways chase after a movie.\" In late September, it opened the New York Film Festival. The New York Times published its review the day of the opening. Janet Maslin called the film a \"triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino's ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color ... [He] has come up with a work of such depth, wit and blazing originality that it places him in the front ranks of American film makers.\"On October 14, 1994, Pulp Fiction went into general release in the United States. As Peter Biskind describes, \"It was not platformed, that is, it did not open in a handful of theaters and roll out slowly as word of mouth built, the traditional way of releasing an indie film; it went wide immediately, into 1,100 theaters.\" In the eyes of some cultural critics, Reservoir Dogs had given Tarantino a reputation for glamorizing violence. Miramax played with the issue in its marketing campaign: \"You won't know the facts till you've seen the fiction\", went one slogan. Pulp Fiction was the top-grossing film at the US box office its first weekend with a gross of $9,311,882, edging out a Sylvester Stallone vehicle, The Specialist, which was in its second week and playing at more than twice as many theaters. The gross claimed by Miramax was disputed by others. Warner Bros. initially reported an estimated gross of $8.9 million for The Specialist with Bob Weinstein then reporting a gross for Pulp Fiction of $9.1 million, claiming that the film was on another 100 screens that had previously been overlooked. Warners then updated their gross to $9.3 million, claiming they had made a calculation error.\n",
      "Early Monday morning, Miramax reported a gross of $9.3 million with Warners reporting $8.9 million for The Specialist, placing Pulp Fiction first but other industry sources did not believe Miramax's numbers. Variety estimated that Pulp Fiction grossed $8.6 to $9 million for the weekend.Against its budget of $8.5 million and about $10 million in marketing costs, Pulp Fiction grossed $107.93 million at the U.S. box office, making it the first Miramax film to surpass $100 million in the United States and Canada. Worldwide, it took in nearly $213 million. In terms of domestic grosses, it was the tenth biggest film of 1994, even though it played on substantially fewer screens than any other film in the top 20. Popular engagement with the film, such as speculation about the contents of the precious briefcase, \"indicates the kind of cult status that Pulp Fiction achieved almost immediately.\" As MovieMaker puts it, \"The movie was nothing less than a national cultural phenomenon.\" Abroad, as well: in Britain, where it opened a week after its U.S. release, not only was the film a big hit, but in book form its screenplay became the most successful in UK publishing history, a top-ten bestseller.\n",

      "=== Critical response ===\n",
      "On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 116 reviews, with an average rating of 9.20/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"One of the most influential films of the 1990s, Pulp Fiction is a delirious post-modern mix of neo-noir thrills, pitch-black humor, and pop-culture touchstones.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 95 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.The response of major American film reviewers was widely favorable. Roger Ebert called it \"a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations... The screenplay by Tarantino and Roger Avary so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it – the noses of those zombie writers who take 'screenwriting' classes that teach them the formulas for 'hit films'\". Richard Corliss of TIME wrote, \"It towers over the year's other movies as majestically and menacingly as a gang lord at a preschool. It dares Hollywood films to be this smart about going this far. If good directors accept Tarantino's implicit challenge, the movie theater could again be a great place to live in.\" In Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, \"The miracle of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is how, being composed of secondhand, debased parts, it succeeds in gleaming like something new.\" \"You get intoxicated by it,\" wrote Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman, \"high on the rediscovery of how pleasurable a movie can be. I'm not sure I've ever encountered a filmmaker who combined discipline and control with sheer wild-ass joy the way that Tarantino does.\" \"There's a special kick that comes from watching something this thrillingly alive\", wrote Peter Travers of Rolling Stone. \"Pulp Fiction is indisputably great.\"The Los Angeles Times was one of the few major news outlets to publish a negative review on the film's opening weekend. Kenneth Turan wrote, \"The writer-director appears to be straining for his effects. Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities.\" Some who reviewed it in the following weeks took more exception to the predominant critical reaction than to Pulp Fiction itself. While not panning the film, Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic felt that \"the way that [it] has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. Pulp Fiction nourishes, abets, cultural slumming.\" Responding to comparisons between Tarantino's film and the work of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard, especially his first, most famous feature, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, \"The fact that Pulp Fiction is garnering more extravagant raves than Breathless ever did tells you plenty about which kind of cultural references are regarded as more fruitful – namely, the ones we already have and don't wish to expand.\" Observing in the National Review that \"[n]o film arrives with more advance hype\", John Simon was unswayed: \"titillation cures neither hollowness nor shallowness\".Debate about the film spread beyond the review pages, with its violence often being the theme. In The Washington Post, Donna Britt described how she was happy not to see Pulp Fiction on a recent weekend and thus avoid \"discussing the rousing scene in which a gunshot sprays somebody's brains around a car interior\". Some commentators took exception to the film's frequent use of the word \"nigger\" (mentioned 18 times). In the Chicago Tribune, Todd Boyd argued that the word's recurrence \"has the ability to signify the ultimate level of hipness for white males who have historically used their perception of black masculinity as the embodiment of cool\". In Britain, James Wood, writing in The Guardian, set the tone for much subsequent criticism: \"Tarantino represents the final triumph of postmodernism, which is to empty the artwork of all content, thus avoiding its capacity to do anything except helplessly represent our agonies ... Only in this age could a writer as talented as Tarantino produce artworks so vacuous, so entirely stripped of any politics, metaphysics, or moral interest.\"\n",

      "=== Awards season ===\n",
      "Around the turn of the year, Pulp Fiction was named Best Picture by the National Society of Film Critics, National Board of Review, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, Boston Society of Film Critics, Society of Texas Film Critics, Southeastern Film Critics Association, and Kansas City Film Critics Circle. Tarantino was named Best Director by all seven of those organizations as well as by the New York Film Critics Circle and Chicago Film Critics Association. The screenplay won several prizes, with various awarding bodies ascribing credit differently. At the 52nd Golden Globe Awards, Tarantino, named as sole recipient of the Best Screenplay honor, failed to mention Avary in his acceptance speech. In February 1995, the film received seven Oscar nominations – Best Picture, Director, Actor (Travolta), Supporting Actor (Jackson), Supporting Actress (Thurman), Original Screenplay, and Film Editing. Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman were each nominated as well for the 1st Screen Actors Guild Awards, presented on February 25, but none took home the honor. At the Academy Awards ceremony the following month, Tarantino and Avary were announced as joint winners of the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The furor around the film was still going strong: much of the March issue of Artforum was devoted to its critical dissection. Pulp Fiction garnered four honors at the Independent Spirit Awards, held at the end of the month – Best Feature, Best Director, Male Lead (Jackson), and Best Screenplay (Tarantino). At the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA), Tarantino and Avary shared the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, and Jackson won for Best Supporting Actor. The film was nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.The February 2020 issue of New York Magazine lists Pulp Fiction alongside Citizen Kane, Sunset Boulevard, Dr. Strangelove, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Conversation, Nashville, Taxi Driver, The Elephant Man, In the Bedroom, There Will Be Blood, and Roma as \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars\".\n",

      "== Legacy and influence ==\n",
      "Pulp Fiction quickly came to be regarded as one of the most significant films of its era. In 1995, in a special edition of Siskel & Ebert devoted to Tarantino, Gene Siskel argued that the work posed a major challenge to the \"ossification of American movies with their brutal formulas\". In Siskel's view,\n",
      "\n",
      "the violent intensity of Pulp Fiction calls to mind other violent watershed films that were considered classics in their time and still are. Hitchcock's Psycho [1960], Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde [1967], and Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange [1971]. Each film shook up a tired, bloated movie industry and used a world of lively lowlifes to reflect how dull other movies had become. And that, I predict, will be the ultimate honor for Pulp Fiction. Like all great films, it criticizes other movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ken Dancyger writes that its \"imitative and innovative style\" – like that of its predecessor, Reservoir Dogs – represents\n",
      "\n",
      "a new phenomenon, the movie whose style is created from the context of movie life rather than real life. The consequence is twofold – the presumption of deep knowledge on the part of the audience of those forms such as the gangster films or Westerns, horror films or adventure films. And that the parody or alteration of that film creates a new form, a different experience for the audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a widely covered speech on May 31, 1995, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole attacked the American entertainment industry for peddling \"nightmares of depravity\". Pulp Fiction was soon associated with his charges concerning gratuitous violence. Dole had not mentioned the film; he cited two less-celebrated movies based on Tarantino screenplays, Natural Born Killers and True Romance. In September 1996, Dole did accuse Pulp Fiction – which he had not seen – of promoting \"the romance of heroin\".Paula Rabinowitz expresses the general film industry opinion that Pulp Fiction \"simultaneously resurrected John Travolta and film noir\". In Peter Biskind's description, it created a \"guys-with-guns frenzy\". The film has also been labeled as a black comedy and a \"neo-noir\". Critic Geoffrey O'Brien, however, argued against the classification of Pulp Fiction into the neo-noir genre: \"The old-time noir passions, the brooding melancholy and operatic death scenes, would be altogether out of place in the crisp and brightly lit wonderland that Tarantino conjures up. [It is] neither neo-noir nor a parody of noir.\" Similarly, Nicholas Christopher calls it \"more gangland camp than neo-noir\", and Foster Hirsch suggests that its \"trippy fantasy landscape\" characterizes it more definitively than any genre label. Regardless, the stylistic influence of Pulp Fiction soon became apparent. Less than a year after the picture's release, British critic Jon Ronson attended the National Film School's end-of-semester screenings and assessed the impact: \"Out of the five student movies I watched, four incorporated violent shoot-outs over a soundtrack of iconoclastic 70s pop hits, two climaxed with all the main characters shooting each other at once, and one had two hitmen discussing the idiosyncrasies of The Brady Bunch before offing their victim. Not since Citizen Kane has one man appeared from relative obscurity to redefine the art of moviemaking.\" Among the first Hollywood films cited as its imitators were Destiny Turns on the Radio (1995), in which Tarantino acted, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (1995), and 2 Days in the Valley (1996). It \"triggered a myriad of clones\", writes Fiona Villella. Internationally, according to David Desser, it \"not only influenced a British brand of noir, but extended the noir vision virtually around the world\". Pulp Fiction's effect on film form was still reverberating in 2007, when David Denby of The New Yorker credited it with initiating the ongoing cycle of disordered cinematic narratives.According to Variety, the trajectory of Pulp Fiction from Cannes launch to commercial smash \"forever altered the game\" of so-called independent cinema. It \"cemented Miramax's place as the reigning indie superpower\", writes Biskind. \"Pulp became the Star Wars of independents, exploding expectations for what an indie film could do at the box office.\" The film's large financial return on its small budget\n",
      "\n",
      "transform[ed] the industry's attitude toward the lowly indies ... spawning a flock of me-too classics divisions ... [S]mart studio executives suddenly woke up to the fact that grosses and market share, which got all the press, were not the same as profits ... Once the studios realized that they could exploit the economies of (small) scale, they more or less gave up buying or remaking the films themselves, and either bought the distributors, as Disney had Miramax, or started their own ... copy[ing] Miramax's marketing and distribution strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2001, Variety, noting the increasing number of actors switching back and forth between expensive studio films and low-budget independent or indie-style projects, suggested that the \"watershed moment for movie stars\" came with the decision by Willis – one of Hollywood's highest-paid performers – to appear in Pulp Fiction.It has been described as a \"major cultural event\", an \"international phenomenon\" that influenced television, music, literature, and advertising. Not long after its release, it was identified as a significant focus of attention within the growing community of Internet users. Adding Pulp Fiction to his roster of The Great Movies in 2001, Roger Ebert called it \"the most influential film of the decade\". Four years later, Time's Corliss wrote much the same: \"(unquestionably) the most influential American movie of the 90s\".Several scenes and images from the film achieved iconic status; in 2008, Entertainment Weekly declared, \"You'd be hard-pressed, by now, to name a moment from Quentin Tarantino's film that isn't iconic.\" Jules and Vincent's \"Royale with Cheese\" dialogue became famous. It was referenced more than a decade and a half later in the Travolta vehicle From Paris with Love. The adrenalin shot to Mia Wallace's heart is on Premiere's list of \"100 Greatest Movie Moments\". The scene of Travolta and Thurman's characters dancing has been frequently homaged, most unambiguously in the 2005 film Be Cool, starring the same two actors. The image of Travolta and Jackson's characters standing side by side in suit and tie, pointing their guns, has also become widely familiar. In 2007, BBC News reported that \"London transport workers have painted over an iconic mural by 'guerrilla artist' Banksy ... The image depicted a scene from Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, with Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta clutching bananas instead of guns.\" Certain lines were adopted popularly as catchphrases, in particular Marsellus's threat, \"I'm 'a get medieval on your ass.\" Jules's \"Ezekiel\" recitation was voted the fourth greatest movie speech of all time in a 2004 poll. One of the more notable homages to Jules \"Biblical\" quote was one Jackson himself played a part in, near the end of 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Jackson's character Col. Nick Fury, presumed dead, visits his own gravestone, on which, below Fury's name is inscribed \"The path of the righteous man ...\" Ezekiel 25:17. In 2019, it was reported that Dominic Cummings, special political adviser to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, quoted Jules by telling Conservative MPs to \"be cool like Fonzies\" as political pressure built to request an extension to the date of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.Pulp Fiction now appears in several critical assessments of all-time great films. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it the best film of the past quarter-century. That same year, the American Film Institute's \"Ten Top Ten\" poll ranked it number 7 all-time in the gangster film genre. In 2007, it was voted 94th overall on the AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. In 2005, it was named one of \"Time's All-Time 100 Movies\". As of September 2018, it is number 54 on Metacritic's list of all-time highest scores. The film ranks very highly in popular surveys. A 2008 Empire poll combining the opinions of readers, movie industry professionals, and critics named Pulp Fiction the ninth-best film of all time. In a 2006 readers' poll by the British magazine Total Film, it ranked as the number three film in history. It was voted as the fourth-greatest film of all time in a nationwide poll for Britain's Channel 4 in 2001. In 2015, Pulp Fiction ranked 28th on BBC's \"100 Greatest American Films\" list, voted on by film critics from around the world.\n",

      "== Critical analysis ==\n",
      "Tarantino has stated that he originally planned \"to do a Black Mask movie\", referring to the magazine largely responsible for popularizing hardboiled detective fiction. \"[I]t kind of went somewhere else\". Geoffrey O'Brien sees the result as connected \"rather powerfully to a parallel pulp tradition: the tales of terror and the uncanny practiced by such writers as Cornell Woolrich [and] Fredric Brown ... Both dealt heavily in the realm of improbable coincidences and cruel cosmic jokes, a realm that Pulp Fiction makes its own.\" In particular, O'Brien finds a strong affinity between the intricate plot mechanics and twists of Brown's novels and the recursive, interweaving structure of Pulp Fiction. Philip French describes the film's narrative as a \"circular movement or Möbius strip of a kind Resnais and Robbe-Grillet would admire\". James Mottram regards crime novelist Elmore Leonard, whose influence Tarantino has acknowledged, as the film's primary literary antecedent. He suggests that Leonard's \"rich dialogue\" is reflected in Tarantino's \"popular-culture-strewn jive\"; he also points to the acute, extremely dark sense of humor Leonard applies to the realm of violence as a source of inspiration.Film scholar/historian Robert Kolker sees the \"flourishes, the apparent witty banality of the dialogue, the goofy fracturing of temporality [as] a patina over a pastiche. The pastiche ... is essentially of two films that Tarantino can't seem to get out of his mind: Mean Streets [1973; directed by Martin Scorsese, who loved Pulp Fiction and the way the film was told] and The Killing [1956; directed by Stanley Kubrick].\" He contrasts Pulp Fiction with postmodern Hollywood predecessors Hudson Hawk (1991; starring Willis) and Last Action Hero (1993; starring Arnold Schwarzenegger) that \"took the joke too far ... simply mocked or suggested that they were smarter than the audience\" and flopped. Todd McCarthy writes that the film's \"striking widescreen compositions often contain objects in extreme close-up as well as vivid contrasts, sometimes bringing to mind the visual strategies of Sergio Leone\", an acknowledged hero of Tarantino's. To Martin Rubin, the \"expansive, brightly colored widescreen visuals\" evoke comedy directors such as Frank Tashlin and Blake Edwards.The movie's host of pop culture allusions, ranging from the famous image of Marilyn Monroe's skirt flying up over a subway grating to Jules addressing a soon-to-be victim as \"Flock of Seagulls\" because of his haircut, have led many critics to discuss it within the framework of postmodernism. Describing the film in 2005 as Tarantino's \"postmodern masterpiece ... to date\", David Walker writes that it \"is marked by its playful reverence for the 1950s ... and its constantly teasing and often deferential references to other films\". He characterizes its convoluted narrative technique as \"postmodern tricksiness\". Calling the film a \"terminally hip postmodern collage\", Foster Hirsch finds Pulp Fiction far from a masterpiece: \"authoritative, influential, and meaningless\". Set \"in a world that could exist only in the movies\", it is \"a succulent guilty pleasure, beautifully made junk food for cinéastes\". O'Brien, dismissing attempts to associate the movie with film noir, argues that \"Pulp Fiction is more a guided tour of an infernal theme park decorated with cultural detritus, Buddy Holly and Mamie Van Doren, fragments of blaxploitation and Roger Corman and Shogun Assassin, music out of a twenty-four-hour oldies station for which all the decades since the fifties exist simultaneously.\" Catherine Constable takes the moment in which a needle filled with adrenalin is plunged into the comatose Mia's heart as exemplary. She proposes that it \"can be seen as effecting her resurrection from the dead, simultaneously recalling and undermining the Gothic convention of the vampire's stake. On this model, the referencing of previous aesthetic forms and styles moves beyond ... empty pastiche, sustaining an 'inventive and affirmative' mode of postmodernism.\"Mark T. Conard asks, \"[W]hat is the film about?\" and answers, \"American nihilism.\" Hirsch suggests, \"If the film is actually about anything other than its own cleverness, it seems dedicated to the dubious thesis that hit men are part of the human family.\" Richard Alleva argues that \"Pulp Fiction has about as much to do with actual criminality or violence as Cyrano de Bergerac with the realities of seventeenth-century France or The Prisoner of Zenda with Balkan politics.\" He reads the movie as a form of romance whose allure is centered in the characters' nonnaturalistic discourse, \"wise-guy literate, media-smart, obscenely epigrammatic\". In Alan Stone's view, the \"absurd dialogue\", like that between Vincent and Jules in the scene where the former accidentally kills Marvin, \"unexpectedly transforms the meaning of the violence cliché ... Pulp Fiction unmasks the macho myth by making it laughable and deheroicizes the power trip glorified by standard Hollywood violence.\" Stone reads the film as \"politically correct. There is no nudity and no violence directed against women ... [It] celebrates interracial friendship and cultural diversity; there are strong women and strong black men, and the director swims against the current of class stereotype.\"Where Stone sees a celebration, Kolker finds a vacuum: \"The postmodern insouciance, violence, homophobia, and racism of Pulp Fiction were perfectly acceptable because the film didn't pretend seriousness and therefore didn't mock it.\" Calling it the \"acme of postmodern nineties filmmaking\", he explains, \"the postmodern is about surfaces; it is flattened spatiality in which event and character are in a steady state of reminding us that they are pop-cultural figures.\" According to Kolker:\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why Pulp Fiction was so popular. Not because all audiences got all or any of its references to Scorsese and Kubrick, but because the narrative and spatial structure of the film never threatened to go beyond themselves into signification. The film's cycle of racist and homophobic jokes might threaten to break out into a quite nasty view of the world, but this nastiness keeps being laughed off – by the mock intensity of the action, the prowling, confronting, perverse, confined, and airless nastiness of the world Tarantino creates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henry A. Giroux argues that Tarantino \"empties violence of any critical social consequences, offering viewers only the immediacy of shock, humor, and irony-without-insight as elements of mediation. None of these elements gets beyond the seduction of voyeuristic gazing ... [t]he facile consumption of shocking images and hallucinatory delight.\"Regarding the violence and nihilism in the film, Pamela Demory has suggested that Pulp Fiction should be seen in light of the short stories of Flannery O'Connor, which likewise feature \"religious elements, banality, and violence with grotesque humor.\" Discussing \"the connection between violence and redemption,\" Demory concludes that while O'Connor's purpose is to convince readers \"of the powerful force of evil in the world and of our need for grace,\" Tarantino \"seeks to demonstrate that in spite of everything we have seen in the film – all the violence, degradation, death, crime, amoral behavior – grace is still possible; there might still be a God who doesn't judge us on merits.\"\n",

      "==== Cinema ====\n",
      "Pulp Fiction is full of homages to other movies. \"Tarantino's characters\", writes Gary Groth, \"inhabit a world where the entire landscape is composed of Hollywood product. Tarantino is a cinematic kleptomaniac – he literally can't help himself.\" Two scenes in particular have prompted discussion of the film's highly intertextual style. Many have assumed that the dance sequence at Jack Rabbit Slim's was intended as a reference to Travolta's star-making performance as Tony Manero in the epochal Saturday Night Fever (1977); Tarantino, however, credits a scene in the Jean-Luc Godard film Bande à part (1964) with the inspiration. According to the filmmaker;\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody thinks that I wrote this scene just to have John Travolta dancing. But the scene existed before John Travolta was cast. But once he was cast, it was like, \"Great. We get to see John dance. All the better.\"... My favorite musical sequences have always been in Godard, because they just come out of nowhere. It's so infectious, so friendly. And the fact that it's not a musical, but he's stopping the movie to have a musical sequence, makes it all the more sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerome Charyn argues that, beyond \"all the better\", Travolta's presence is essential to the power of the scene, and of the film:\n",
      "\n",
      "Travolta's entire career becomes \"backstory\", the myth of a movie star who has fallen out of favor, but still resides in our memory as the king of disco. We keep waiting for him to shed his paunch, put on a white polyester suit, and enter the 2001 Odyssey club in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he will dance for us and never, never stop. Daniel Day-Lewis couldn't have woken such a powerful longing in us. He isn't part of America's own mad cosmology ... Tony Manero [is] an angel sitting on Vince's shoulder ... [Vince and Mia's] actual dance may be closer to the choreography of Anna Karina's shuffle with her two bumbling gangster boyfriends in Bande à part, but even that reference is lost to us, and we're with Tony again ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Estella Tincknell notes that while the \"diner setting seems to be a simulacrum of a 'fifties' restaurant ... the twist contest is a musical sequence which evokes 'the sixties,' while Travolta's dance performance inevitably references 'the seventies' and his appearance in Saturday Night Fever. ... The 'past' thus becomes a more general 'pastness' in which the stylistic signifiers of various decades are loaded in to a single moment.\" She also argues that in this passage the film \"briefly shifts from its habitually ironic discourse to one that references the conventions of the classic film musical and in doing so makes it possible for the film to inhabit an affective space that goes beyond stylistic allusion.\"The pivotal moment in which Marsellus crosses the street in front of Butch's car and notices him evokes the scene in which Marion Crane's boss sees her under similar circumstances in Psycho (1960). Marsellus and Butch are soon held captive by Maynard and Zed, \"two sadistic honkies straight out of Deliverance\" (1972), directed by John Boorman. Zed shares a name with Sean Connery's character in Boorman's follow-up, the science-fiction film Zardoz (1974). When Butch decides to rescue Marsellus, in Glyn White's words, \"he finds a trove of items with film-hero resonances\". Critics have identified these weapons with a range of possible allusions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Hammer – The Toolbox Murders (1978)\n",
      "Baseball bat – Walking Tall (1973); The Untouchables (1987)\n",
      "Chainsaw – The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974); Evil Dead II (1987)\n",
      "Katana (samurai sword) – many, including Seven Samurai (1954); The Yakuza (1975); Shogun Assassin (1980)At the conclusion of the scene, a portentous line of Marsellus's echoes one from the crime drama Charley Varrick (1973), directed by another of Tarantino's heroes, Don Siegel; the name of the character who speaks it there is Maynard.David Bell argues that far from going against the \"current of class stereotype\", this scene, like Deliverance, \"mobilize[s] a certain construction of poor white country folk – and particularly their sexualization ... 'rustic sexual expression often takes the form of homosexual rape' in American movies.\" Stephen Paul Miller believes the Pulp Fiction scene goes down much easier than the one it echoes: \"The buggery perpetrated is not at all as shocking as it was in Deliverance ... The nineties film reduces seventies competition, horror, and taboo into an entertainingly subtle adrenaline play – a fiction, a pulp fiction.\" Giroux reads the rape scene homage similarly: \"in the end Tarantino's use of parody is about repetition, transgression, and softening the face of violence by reducing it to the property of film history.\" In Groth's view, the crucial difference is that \"in Deliverance the rape created the film's central moral dilemma whereas in Pulp Fiction it was merely 'the single weirdest day of [Butch's] life.'\" (\"American Me did it too,\" Tarantino observed. \"There's like three butt-fucking scenes in American Me. That's definitely the one to beat in that particular category!\")\n",
      "Neil Fulwood focuses on Butch's weapon selection, writing, \"Here, Tarantino's love of movies is at its most open and nonjudgemental, tipping a nod to the noble and the notorious, as well as sending up his own reputation as an enfant terrible of movie violence. Moreover, the scene makes a sly comment about the readiness of cinema to seize upon whatever is to hand for its moments of mayhem and murder.\" White asserts that \"the katana he finally, and significantly, selects identifies him with ... honourable heroes.\" Conard argues that the first three items symbolize a nihilism that Butch is rejecting. The traditional Japanese sword, in contrasts, represents a culture with a well-defined moral code and thus connects Butch with a more meaningful approach to life.The biker film Nam's Angels is also shown with Fabienne characterizing it as \"A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Television ====\n",
      "Robert Miklitsch argues that \"Tarantino's telephilia\" may be more central to the guiding sensibility of Pulp Fiction than the filmmaker's love for rock 'n' roll and even cinema:\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about his generation, one that came of age in the '70s, Tarantino has commented that the \"number one thing we all shared wasn't music, that was a Sixties thing. Our culture was television.\" A random list of the TV programs referenced in Pulp Fiction confirms his observation: Speed Racer, Clutch Cargo, The Brady Bunch, The Partridge Family, The Avengers, The Three Stooges, The Flintstones, I Spy, Green Acres, Kung Fu, Happy Days, and last but not least, Mia's fictional pilot, Fox Force Five.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The above list, with the possible exception of The Avengers,\" writes Miklitsch, \"suggests that Pulp Fiction has less of an elective affinity with the cinematic avant-gardism of Godard than with mainstream network programming.\" Jonathan Rosenbaum had brought TV into his analysis of the Tarantino/Godard comparison, acknowledging that the directors were similar in wanting to cram everything they like onscreen: \"But the differences between what Godard likes and what Tarantino likes and why are astronomical; it's like comparing a combined museum, library, film archive, record shop, and department store with a jukebox, a video-rental outlet, and an issue of TV Guide.\"Sharon Willis focuses on the way a television show (Clutch Cargo) marks the beginning of, and plays on through, the scene between young Butch and his father's comrade-in-arms. The Vietnam War veteran is played by Christopher Walken, whose presence in the role evokes his performance as a traumatized G.I. in the Vietnam War movie The Deer Hunter (1978). Willis writes that \"when Captain Koons enters the living room, we see Walken in his function as an image retrieved from a repertoire of 1970s television and movie versions of ruined masculinity in search of rehabilitation ... [T]he gray light of the television presiding over the scene seems to inscribe the ghostly paternal gaze.\" Miklitsch asserts that, for some critics, the film is a \"prime example of the pernicious ooze-like influence of mass culture exemplified by their bête noire: TV.\" Kolker might not disagree, arguing that \"Pulp Fiction is a simulacrum of our daily exposure to television; its homophobes, thugs and perverts, sentimental boxers and pimp promoters move through a series of long-take tableaux: we watch, laugh, and remain with nothing to comprehend.\"\n",

      "==== The mysterious 666 briefcase ====\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of the mysterious suitcase lock is 666, the \"Number of the Beast\". Tarantino has said there is no explanation for its contents – it is simply a MacGuffin, a pure plot device. Originally, the case was to contain diamonds, but this was seen as too mundane. For filming purposes, it contained a hidden orange light bulb that produced an otherworldly glow when the case was opened. In a 2007 video interview with fellow director and friend Robert Rodriguez, Tarantino purportedly \"reveals\" the secret contents of the briefcase, but the film cuts out and skips the scene in the style employed in Tarantino and Rodriguez's Grindhouse (2007), with an intertitle that reads \"Missing Reel\". The interview resumes with Rodriguez discussing how radically the \"knowledge\" of the briefcase's contents alters one's understanding of the movie.Despite Tarantino's statements, many solutions to what one scholar calls this \"unexplained postmodern puzzle\" have been proposed. A strong similarity has often been observed with Robert Aldrich's 1955 film noir Kiss Me Deadly. That movie, features a glowing briefcase housing an atomic explosive. In their review of Alex Cox's 1984 film Repo Man in The Daily Telegraph, Nick Cowen and Hari Patience suggest that Pulp Fiction may also owe \"a debt of inspiration\" to the glowing car trunk in that film. In scholar Paul Gormley's view, this connection with Kiss Me Deadly, and a similar one with Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), makes it possible to read the eerie glow as symbolic of violence itself. The idea that the briefcase contains Marsellus's soul gained popular currency in the mid-1990s. Analyzing the notion, Roger Ebert dismissed it as \"nothing more than a widely distributed urban legend given false credibility by the mystique of the Net\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Jules' Bible passage ====\n",
      "Jules ritually recites what he describes as a biblical passage, Ezekiel 25:17, before he executes someone. The passage is heard three times – in the introductory sequence in which Jules and Vincent reclaim Marsellus's briefcase from the doomed Brett; that same recitation a second time, at the beginning of \"The Bonnie Situation\", which overlaps the end of the earlier sequence; and in the epilogue at the diner. The first version of the passage is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.\n",
      "The second version, from the diner scene, is identical except for the final line: \"And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While the final two sentences of Jules's speech are similar to the actual cited passage, the first two are fabricated from various biblical phrases. The text of Ezekiel 25 preceding verse 17 indicates that God's wrath is retribution for the hostility of the Philistines. In the King James Version from which Jules's speech is adapted, Ezekiel 25:17 reads in its entirety:\n",
      "\n",
      "And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay My vengeance upon them.\n",
      "Tarantino's primary inspiration for the speech was the work of Japanese martial arts star Sonny Chiba. Its text and its identification as Ezekiel 25:17 derive from an almost identical creed that appears at the beginning of the Chiba movie Karate Kiba (The Bodyguard; 1976), where it is both shown as a scrolling text and read by an offscreen narrator.The version seen at the beginning of The Bodyguard (1976) is as follows:\n",

      "The path of the righteous man and defender is beset on all sides by the inequity of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper, and the father of lost children. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious anger, who poison and destroy my brothers; and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard when I shall lay my vengeance upon them!\n",
      "In the 1980s television series Kage no Gundan (Shadow Warriors), Chiba's character would lecture the villain-of-the-week about how the world must be rid of evil before killing him. A killer delivers a similar biblical rant in Modesty Blaise, the hardback but pulp-style novel Vincent is shown with in two scenes.Two critics who have analyzed the role of the speech find different ties between Jules's transformation and the issue of postmodernity. Gormley argues that unlike the film's other major characters – Marsellus aside – Jules is:\n",
      "\n",
      "linked to a \"thing\" beyond postmodern simulation ... [T]his is perhaps most marked when he moves on from being a simulation of a Baptist preacher, spouting Ezekiel because it was \"just a cool thing to say ...\" In his conversion, Jules is shown to be cognizant of a place beyond this simulation, which, in this case, the film constructs as God.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adele Reinhartz writes that the \"depth of Jules's transformation\" is indicated by the difference in his two deliveries of the passage: \"In the first, he is a majestic and awe-inspiring figure, proclaiming the prophecy with fury and self-righteousness ... In the second ... he appears to be a different sort of man altogether ... [I]n true postmodern fashion, [he] reflects on the meaning of his speech and provides several different ways that it might pertain to his current situation.\" Similar to Gormley, Conard argues that as Jules reflects on the passage, it dawns on him \"that it refers to an objective framework of value and meaning that is absent from his life\"; to Conard, this contrasts with the film's prevalent representation of a nihilistic culture. Rosenbaum finds much less in Jules's revelation: \"[T]he spiritual awakening at the end of Pulp Fiction, which Jackson performs beautifully, is a piece of jive avowedly inspired by kung-fu movies. It may make you feel good, but it certainly doesn't leave you any wiser.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== The bathroom ====\n",
      "Much of Pulp Fiction's action revolves around characters who are either in the bathroom or need to use the toilet. To a lesser extent, Tarantino's other films also feature this narrative element. At Jack Rabbit Slim's, Mia goes to \"powder her nose\" – literally; she snorts coke in the restroom, surrounded by a bevy of women vainly primping. Butch and Fabienne play an extended scene in their motel bathroom, he in the shower, she brushing her teeth; the next morning, but just a few seconds later in screen time, she is again brushing her teeth. As Jules and Vincent confront Brett and two of his pals, a fourth man is hiding in the bathroom – his actions will lead to Jules' transformative \"moment of clarity\". After Marvin's absurd death, Vincent and Jules wash up in Jimmie's bathroom, where they get into a contretemps over a bloody hand towel. When the diner hold-up turns into a standoff, \"Honey Bunny\" whines, \"I gotta go pee!\"As described by Peter and Will Brooker, \"In three significant moments Vincent retires to the bathroom [and] returns to an utterly changed world where death is threatened.\" The threat increases in magnitude as the narrative progresses chronologically, and is realized in the third instance:\n",
      "\n",
      "Vincent and Jules's diner breakfast and philosophical conversation is aborted by Vincent's bathroom break; an armed robbery ensues while Vincent is reading on the toilet.\n",
      "While Vincent is in the bathroom worrying about the possibility of going too far with Marsellus's wife, Mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses.\n",
      "During a stakeout at Butch's apartment, Vincent emerges from the toilet with his book and is killed by Butch.In the Brookers' analysis, \"Through Vince ... we see the contemporary world as utterly contingent, transformed, disastrously, in the instant you are not looking.\" Fraiman finds it particularly significant that Vincent is reading Modesty Blaise in two of these instances. She links this fact with the traditional derisive view of women as \"the archetypal consumers of pulp\":\n",
      "\n",
      "Locating popular fiction in the bathroom, Tarantino reinforces its association with shit, already suggested by the dictionary meanings of \"pulp\" that preface the movie: moist, shapeless matter; also, lurid stories on cheap paper. What we have then is a series of damaging associations – pulp, women, shit – that taint not only male producers of mass-market fiction but also male consumers. Perched on the toilet with his book, Vincent is feminized by sitting instead of standing as well as by his trashy tastes; preoccupied by the anal, he is implicitly infantilized and homosexualized; and the seemingly inevitable result is being pulverized by Butch with a Czech M61 submachine gun. That this fate has to do with Vincent's reading habits is strongly suggested by a slow tilt from the book on the floor directly up to the corpse spilled into the tub.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willis reads Pulp Fiction in almost precisely the opposite direction, finding \"its overarching project as a drive to turn shit into gold. This is one way of describing the project of redeeming and recycling popular culture, especially the popular culture of one's childhood, as is Tarantino's wont as well as his stated aim.\" Despite that, argues Fraiman, \"Pulp Fiction demonstrates ... that even an open pulpophile like Tarantino may continue to feel anxious and emasculated by his preferences.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Accolades ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Pulp Fiction won eight major awards from a total of twenty-six nominations, including a Best Original Screenplay win at the 67th Academy Awards. Also, in the balloting by the National Society of Film Critics, Samuel L. Jackson was the runner-up in both the Best Actor and the Best Supporting Actor categories.American Film Institute Lists\n",

      "Hamilton narrates Alexander Hamilton's life in two acts, and details among other things his involvement in the American Revolutionary War as an aide-de-camp to George Washington, his marriage to Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, his career as a lawyer and secretary of the treasury, and his interactions with Aaron Burr which culminates in their duel at the end of Hamilton's life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Act I ===\n",
      "The orphan Alexander Hamilton experiences a hard early life, and through his smarts and the charitability of the townsfolks leaves his home, the island of Nevis (\"Alexander Hamilton\"). As a student at King's College in New York in 1776, Hamilton meets Aaron Burr, John Laurens, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Hercules Mulligan (\"Aaron Burr, Sir\"), and impresses them with his rhetorical skills (\"My Shot\"). The latter three and Hamilton affirm their revolutionary goals to each other, while Burr remains apprehensive (\"The Story of Tonight\"). Later, the daughters of the wealthy Philip Schuyler—Peggy, Angelica, and Eliza—go into town and share their opinion on the upcoming revolution (\"The Schuyler Sisters\"). Loyalist bishop Samuel Seabury argues against the revolution (\"Farmer Refuted\") and King George III insists on his authority (\"You'll Be Back\"). During the New York and New Jersey campaign, Hamilton accepts a position as George Washington's aide-de-camp despite longing for field command (\"Right Hand Man\").\n",
      "At a ball hosted by Philip Schuyler (\"A Winter's Ball\"), Eliza falls helplessly in love with Hamilton, who reciprocates her feelings to the point of marriage (\"Helpless\"), as Angelica suppresses her own feelings for the sake of their happiness (\"Satisfied\"). After the wedding, Burr and Hamilton congratulate each other's successes (\"The Story of Tonight (Reprise)\") while Burr reflects on Hamilton's swift rise while considering his own more cautious career as well as his affair with Theodosia, the wife of a British officer (\"Wait For It\").\n",
      "As conditions worsen for the Continental Army (\"Stay Alive\"), Hamilton aids Laurens in a duel against Major General Charles Lee (\"Ten Duel Commandments\"), after which Washington temporarily suspends him from the army (\"Meet Me Inside\"). Back home, Eliza reveals that she is pregnant with their first child, Philip, and asks Hamilton to slow down to take in what has happened in their lives (\"That Would Be Enough\"). After Lafayette persuades France to get involved on the colonists' side, he urges Washington to call Hamilton back to help plan the final Battle of Yorktown. Washington agrees (\"Guns and Ships\"), but explains to Hamilton, who is convinced that he should die a martyr and a hero in war, that he should be wary of what he does next because whatever he does will be known for all time (\"History Has Its Eyes on You\"). At the Battle of Yorktown, Hamilton meets up with Lafayette to take down the British, revealing that Mulligan was recruited as a spy, helping them figure out how to trap the British and win the war (\"Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\").\n",
      "Soon after the victory of Yorktown, King George asks the newborn America how it will succeed on its own (\"What Comes Next?\"). Hamilton's son Philip is born, while Burr has a daughter, Theodosia, and the two tell their children how they will do anything to protect them (\"Dear Theodosia\"). Hamilton receives word that his long-time friend John Laurens has been killed in a seemingly pointless battle after the war was won and throws himself into his work (\"The Laurens Interlude/Tomorrow There'll Be More Of Us\"). He co-authors The Federalist Papers and is selected as Secretary of the Treasury by newly elected President Washington, amidst Eliza begging Hamilton to stay and Angelica moving to London with her new husband (\"Non-Stop\").\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Act II ===\n",
      "In 1789, Thomas Jefferson returns to America from being the U.S. ambassador to France, taking up his newfound position as Secretary of State (\"What'd I Miss\"). Jefferson and Madison debate Hamilton's financial proposals at a Cabinet meeting. Washington tells Hamilton to figure out a compromise to win over Congress (\"Cabinet Battle #1\"). Eliza and her family—along with Angelica, back from London—travel upstate during the summer, while Hamilton stays home to work on the compromise (\"Take a Break\"). Hamilton begins an affair with Maria Reynolds, making him vulnerable to her husband's blackmail (\"Say No To This\"). Hamilton, Jefferson, and James Madison create the Compromise of 1790 over a private dinner, exchanging Hamilton's financial plan for placing the country's permanent capital on the Potomac River. Burr is envious of Hamilton's sway in the government and wishes that he had similar power (\"The Room Where It Happens\"). Burr switches political parties and defeats Philip Schuyler in a race for the Senate, now making Hamilton a rival (\"Schuyler Defeated\").\n",
      "In another Cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in its conflict with Britain. President Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument for remaining neutral (\"Cabinet Battle #2\"). In the wake of this, Jefferson, Madison, and Burr decide to join forces to find a way to discredit Hamilton (\"Washington on Your Side\"). Washington retires from the presidency after his second term, and Hamilton assists in writing a farewell address (\"One Last Time\"). A flabbergasted King George receives word that George Washington has stepped down, and will be replaced by Paris signatory John Adams (\"I Know Him\"). Adams becomes the second President and fires Hamilton, who, in response, publishes an inflammatory critique of the new president (\"The Adams Administration\").\n",
      "Jefferson, Madison, and Burr confront Hamilton about James Reynolds's blackmail, accusing him of \"[embezzlement of] government funds\" (\"We Know\"). Desperate to salvage his political career by proving that he was merely lustful and not corrupt, Hamilton reminisces over his life and how writing has changed his life (\"Hurricane\"), before prophylactically publicizing his affair in the Reynolds Pamphlet, which wrecks his own reputation (\"The Reynolds Pamphlet\"). It also damages his relationship with Eliza, who, in a heartbroken retaliation, burns all the letters Hamilton wrote her, trying to erase herself from history (\"Burn\"). After graduating from college, Philip attempts to defend his father's honor in a duel with George Eacker (\"Blow Us All Away\") but is fatally shot (\"Stay Alive (Reprise)\"), eventually leading to reconciliation between Alexander and Eliza (\"It's Quiet Uptown\").\n",
      "Hamilton's endorsement of Jefferson in the 1800 United States presidential election (\"The Election of 1800\") results in further animosity between Hamilton and Burr, who challenges Hamilton to a duel via an exchange of letters (\"Your Obedient Servant\"). Hamilton writes his last letter in a rush while Eliza tells him to go back to bed (\"Best of Wives and Best of Women\"). Burr reflects on the moments leading up to the duel, while Hamilton reflects on his legacy, before throwing away his shot. Burr fatally shoots Hamilton, and laments that though he survived, he is destined to be remembered as the villain who killed Hamilton (\"The World Was Wide Enough\"). The musical closes with a reflection on historical memory. Jefferson and Madison reflect on Hamilton's legacy, as Eliza tells how she keeps Hamilton's legacy alive through interviewing war veterans, getting help from Angelica, raising funds for the Washington Monument, speaking out against slavery, and establishing the first private orphanage in New York City (\"Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story\"). The musical ends with Hamilton shaking Eliza's hand. Eliza then turns towards the audience and lets out a tearful gasp.\n",

      "{'The Shawshank Redemption': 'In early 1947, Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne arrives at Shawshank State Prison to serve two consecutive life sentences for murdering his wife and her lover. He is befriended by Ellis \"Red\" Redding, a contraband smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures a rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently sexually assaulted by prison gang \"the Sisters\" and their leader, Bogs Diamond.\\nIn 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats and cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to another prison; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, a front to use Andy\\'s financial expertise to manage financial matters for other prison staff, guards from other prisons, and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison\\'s decrepit library.\\nBrooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but he cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. The legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro; Andy plays an excerpt over the public address system and is punished with solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains to a dismissive Red that hope is what gets him through his sentence. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias \"Randall Stephens\".\\nIn 1965, Andy and Red befriend Tommy Williams, a young prisoner incarcerated for burglary. A year later, Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (GED) exam. Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that his cellmate at another prison had claimed responsibility for the murders of which Andy was convicted. Andy brings the information to Norton who refuses to listen and, when Andy mentions the money laundering, sends Andy to solitary confinement and has Hadley fatally shoot Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue the money laundering, but Norton threatens to destroy the library, remove Andy\\'s protection by the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and he tells a skeptical Red that he dreams of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican town on the Pacific coast. Andy also tells him of a specific hayfield near Buxton, asking Red to promise, once he is released, to retrieve a package that Andy buried there. Red worries about Andy\\'s mental well-being, especially when he learns Andy asked a fellow inmate for some rope.\\nAt the next day\\'s roll call, the guards find Andy\\'s cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at a poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the past 19 years. The previous night, Andy used the rope to escape through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking Norton\\'s suit, shoes, and ledger, containing evidence of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens, withdraws over $370,000 of the laundered money from several banks, and mails the ledger and other evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.\\nThe following year, Red is paroled after serving 40 years but struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole by traveling to Fort Hancock, Texas, and crossing the border into Mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. He finds Andy sanding an old boat on a Zihuatanejo beach, and the two reunited friends happily embrace.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Godfather': 'In 1945, the New York City Corleone family don, Vito Corleone, listens to requests during his daughter Connie\\'s wedding to Carlo. Vito\\'s youngest son Michael, a former Marine who has thus far stayed out of the family business, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito\\'s godson, seeks Vito\\'s help in securing a movie role. Vito sends his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to persuade studio president Jack Woltz to offer Johnny the part. Woltz refuses Hagen\\'s request at first, but soon complies after finding the severed head of his prized racing horse in his bed.\\nAs Christmas approaches, drug baron Sollozzo asks Vito to invest in his narcotics business and for police protection. Vito declines, citing that involvement in narcotics would alienate his political connections. Suspicious of Sollozzo\\'s partnership with the Tattaglia crime family, Vito sends his enforcer Luca Brasi to the Tattaglias on an espionage mission. Brasi is garroted to death during the initial meeting. Later, enforcers gun down Vito and coerce Hagen into a meeting. With Vito\\'s first-born Sonny now in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept the narcotics deal. Vito survives the shooting and is visited in the hospital by Michael, who finds him unprotected after NYPD officers on Sollozzo\\'s payroll cleared out Vito\\'s guards. Michael thwarts the attempt on his father\\'s life but is beaten by corrupt police captain Mark McCluskey. After the attempted hit at the hospital, Sonny retaliates with a hit on Bruno Tattaglia. Sollozzo and McCluskey request to meet with Michael and settle the dispute. Michael feigns interest and agrees to meet, but hatches a plan with Sonny and Corleone capo Clemenza to kill them and go into hiding. Michael meets Sollozzo and McCluskey at a Bronx restaurant; after retrieving a handgun planted in the bathroom by Clemenza, he shoots both men dead.\\nDespite a clampdown by the authorities for the killing of a police captain, the Five Families erupt in open warfare. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo, Vito\\'s second son, is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny publicly attacks and threatens Carlo for physically abusing Connie. When he abuses her again, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed and murdered by gangsters at a highway toll booth. In Sicily, Michael meets and marries a local woman, Apollonia, but she is killed shortly thereafter by a car bomb intended for him.\\nDevastated by Sonny\\'s death and tired of war, Vito sets a meeting with the Five Families. He assures them that he will withdraw his opposition to their narcotics business and forgo avenging Sonny\\'s murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay. Kay gives birth to two children in the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo not suited to lead, Michael assumes the position of head of the Corleone family. Vito reveals to Michael that it was Don Barzini who ordered the hit on Sonny and warns him that Barzini would try to kill him at a meeting organized by a traitorous Corleone capo. With Vito\\'s support, Michael relegates Hagen to managing operations in Las Vegas as he is not a \"wartime consigliere\". Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene\\'s stake in the family\\'s casinos and is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.\\nIn 1955, Vito dies of a heart attack while playing with Michael\\'s son Anthony. At Vito\\'s funeral, Tessio asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling his betrayal. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie\\'s baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child\\'s godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the dons of the Five Families, plus Greene, and Tessio is executed for his treachery. Michael extracts Carlo\\'s confession to playing a part in Sonny\\'s murder. He assures Carlo that he is being exiled, not murdered, before Clemenza strangles Carlo. Connie confronts Michael about his involvement in Carlo\\'s death while Kay is in the room. Kay asks Michael if she is telling the truth and is relieved when he denies carrying out the death. As she leaves, capos enter the office and pay reverence to Michael as \"Don Corleone\".\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Dark Knight': 'A gang of masked criminals robs a mafia-owned bank in Gotham City, betraying and killing each other until the sole survivor, the Joker, reveals himself as the mastermind and escapes with the money. The vigilante Batman, district attorney Harvey Dent, and police lieutenant Jim Gordon ally to eliminate Gotham\\'s organized crime. The Batman\\'s true identity, the billionaire Bruce Wayne, publicly supports Dent as Gotham\\'s legitimate protector, as Wayne believes Dent\\'s success will allow the Batman to retire, allowing him to romantically pursue his childhood friend Rachel Dawes, despite her relationship with Dent.\\nGotham\\'s mafia bosses gather to discuss protecting their organizations from the Joker, the police, and the Batman. The Joker interrupts the meeting and offers to kill the Batman for half of the fortune their accountant, Lau, concealed before fleeing to Hong Kong to avoid extradition. With the help of Wayne Enterprises CEO Lucius Fox, the Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and returns him to the custody of Gotham police. His testimony enables Dent to apprehend the crime families. The bosses accept the Joker\\'s offer, and he kills high-profile targets involved in the trial, including the judge and police commissioner. Although Gordon saves the mayor, the Joker threatens that his attacks will continue until the Batman reveals his identity. He targets Dent at a fundraising dinner and throws Rachel out of a window, but Batman rescues her.\\nWayne struggles to understand the Joker\\'s motives, but his butler Alfred Pennyworth says \"some men just want to watch the world burn.\" Dent claims he is the Batman to lure out the Joker, who attacks the police convoy transporting him. The Batman and Gordon apprehend the Joker, and Gordon is promoted to commissioner. At the police station, the Batman interrogates the Joker, who says he finds the Batman entertaining and has no intention of killing him. Having deduced the Batman\\'s feelings for Rachel, the Joker reveals she and Dent are being held separately in buildings rigged to explode. The Batman races to save Rachel while Gordon and the other officers go after Dent, but they discover the Joker gave their positions in reverse. The bombs detonate, killing Rachel and severely burning Dent\\'s face on one side. The Joker escapes custody, extracts the fortune\\'s location from Lau, and burns all of it, killing Lau in the process.\\nWayne Enterprises accountant Coleman Reese deduces the Batman\\'s identity and attempts to expose it, but the Joker threatens to blow up a hospital unless Reese is killed. While the police evacuate hospitals and Gordon struggles to keep Reese alive, the Joker meets with a disillusioned Dent, persuading him to take the law into his own hands and avenge Rachel. Dent defers his decision-making to his half-scarred, two-headed coin, killing the corrupt officers and the mafia involved in Rachel\\'s death. As panic grips the city, the Joker reveals two evacuation ferries, one carrying civilians and the other prisoners, are rigged to explode at midnight unless one group sacrifices the other. To the Joker\\'s disbelief, the passengers refuse to kill one another. The Batman subdues the Joker but refuses to kill him. Before the police arrest the Joker, he says although the Batman proved incorruptible, his plan to corrupt Dent has succeeded.\\nDent takes Gordon\\'s family hostage, blaming his negligence for Rachel\\'s death. He flips his coin to decide their fates, but the Batman tackles him to save Gordon\\'s son, and Dent falls to his death. Believing Dent is the hero the city needs and the truth of his corruption will harm Gotham, the Batman takes the blame for his death and actions and persuades Gordon to conceal the truth. Pennyworth burns an undelivered message to Wayne from Rachel, who said she chose Dent, and Fox destroys the invasive surveillance network that helped the Batman find the Joker. The city mourns Dent as a hero, and the police launch a manhunt for the Batman.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Godfather Part II': 'The film interweaves between events some time after The Godfather and the early life of Vito Corleone.\\n\\n\\n=== Vito ===\\nIn 1901, nine-year-old Vito Andolini flees his country after his whole family is killed in Corleone, Sicily when his father insults local Mafia chieftain Don Ciccio. Vito escapes to New York City and is registered on arrival as \"Vito Corleone\". In 1917, Vito lives in New York with his wife, Carmela, and their infant son, Sonny. He loses his job due to the interference of Don Fanucci, a local Black Hand extortionist. His neighbor Peter Clemenza asks Vito to hide a bag of guns; as thanks, Clemenza enlists Vito\\'s help in stealing a rug, which he gives to Carmela.\\nThe Corleones have three more children: sons Fredo and Michael, and daughter Connie. Meanwhile, Vito, Clemenza, and new partner Salvatore Tessio make income by stealing goods and reselling them door-to-door. This enterprise attracts the attention of Fanucci, who extorts them. Vito convinces his skeptical partners that he will talk Fanucci into accepting a smaller payment. During a neighborhood festa, Vito pays an incredulous Fanucci a much smaller amount than Fanucci demanded and is offered a job as an enforcer. Vito later kills Fanucci in his apartment. Vito becomes a formidable and well-respected community member by helping locals in exchange for \"favors\".\\nIn 1922, Vito and his family visit Sicily, during which he and his business partner Don Tommasino visit Don Ciccio, ostensibly to ask for Ciccio\\'s blessing on their olive oil business. Ciccio asks for the name of Vito\\'s father; Vito reveals his identity and stabs Ciccio to death, avenging his family.\\n\\n\\n=== Michael ===\\nIn 1958, during his son\\'s First Communion party at Lake Tahoe, Michael has a series of meetings in his role as the don of the Corleone crime family. Frank Pentangeli, a Corleone capo, is dismayed that Michael refuses to help defend his Bronx territory against the Rosato brothers, who work for Hyman Roth, a Jewish Mob boss and long-standing Corleone business partner. Senator Pat Geary expects a bribe in exchange for helping Michael obtain casino gaming licenses and insults Italians generally and the Corleones specifically. Michael predicts that Geary will aid him with the licenses but will not be paid. That night, a failed assassination attempt at his home prompts Michael to suddenly depart after confiding in consigliere Tom Hagen that he suspects a traitor within the family.\\nMichael suspects Roth planned the assassination, but falsely tells Roth he suspects Pentangeli. In New York City, under Michael\\'s instructions, Pentangeli attempts to make peace with the Rosatos, but they try to kill him. The attempt fails when a police officer enters the bar where the Rosatos are trying to kill Pentangeli, resulting in the Rosatos fleeing and a brief street shootout where Corleone soldier Willie Cicci is wounded.\\nIn Nevada, Tom Hagen is called to a Carson City brothel run by Michael\\'s older brother Fredo, where Geary has been implicated in the death of a prostitute. Unaware that Michael arranged the \"problem\", Geary accepts Tom\\'s offer to take care of it in return for Geary\\'s political support.\\nA sickly Roth, Michael, and several of their partners travel to Havana to discuss their future Cuban business prospects under the cooperative government of Fulgencio Batista. Michael becomes reluctant to continue operating in Cuba given the ongoing Cuban Revolution. On New Year\\'s Eve, Fredo pretends not to know Johnny Ola, Roth\\'s right-hand man, but later inadvertently reveals they know each other, leading Michael to realize that Fredo is the traitor. Michael orders hits on Ola and Roth; his enforcer strangles Ola with a coat hanger but is killed by Cuban soldiers as he tries to smother Roth. Batista resigns and flees Cuba due to rebel advances. During the ensuing chaos, Michael, Fredo, and Roth separately escape Cuba. Back home, Michael is told that his wife Kay has miscarried.\\nIn Washington, D.C., a Senate committee on organized crime is investigating the Corleone family, but Geary staunchly defends them. Pentangeli agrees to testify against Michael, who he believes had betrayed him to the Rosatos, and is placed under witness protection. On returning to Nevada, Fredo tells Michael that he did not know that Roth had intended to kill him, but that he resents being regarded as stupid by the family and feels that he should have taken over the family after their father\\'s death. Michael disowns Fredo, but gives orders that he is not to be harmed while their mother is alive. Michael sends for Pentangeli\\'s brother from Sicily, and Pentangeli, after seeing his brother in the hearing room, retracts his previous statement indicting Michael in organized crime; the hearing dissolves in an uproar. Kay reveals to Michael that she actually had an abortion, not a miscarriage, and that she intends to leave him and take their children. Outraged, Michael strikes Kay, banishes her from the family, and takes sole custody of the children.\\nCarmela dies some time later, and Michael hurries to wrap up loose ends. At the funeral, Michael appears to forgive Fredo at Connie\\'s behest, but exchanges a glance with Corleone enforcer Al Neri suggesting that Fredo is to be killed. Kay visits her children; as she is saying goodbye, Michael arrives and closes the door on her. Roth is forced to return to the United States after being refused asylum and entry to Israel. On Michael\\'s orders, Roth is assassinated by Corleone caporegime Rocco Lampone during an interview at Miami International Airport; Lampone is killed in turn by a federal agent while attempting to flee the scene. At Pentangeli\\'s compound, Hagen visits and the two discuss how failed plotters against the Roman emperor often committed suicide in return for clemency for their families; Pentangeli is later found dead in his bathtub, having slit his wrists. At the family compound, Michael calls his son Anthony away before he can join Fredo and Neri for a fishing excursion on the lake. Michael then watches from his den as Neri shoots Fredo dead.\\nMichael reminisces about Vito\\'s 50th birthday party on December 7, 1941, the same day Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. While the family waits to surprise Vito, Michael announces that he has dropped out of college and joined the Marines, angering Sonny and surprising Hagen. Fredo is the only member of the family who supports his decision. Vito is heard opening the door and everyone leaves the room to welcome him while Michael sits alone.\\nIn the present day, Michael sits alone at the family compound looking out over the lake.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', '12 Angry Men': 'In the murder trial of a teenage boy from a city slum, accused of murdering his father, the judge instructs the jury to determine his guilt or innocence. The verdict must be unanimous and a guilty verdict will possibly (not mandatorily, unlike in the 1957 film) result in the death penalty. The jury of twelve retires to the jury room.\\nAn initial vote is taken and eleven jurors vote for conviction. Juror 8, the lone dissenter, states that the evidence is circumstantial and the boy deserves a fair deliberation. He questions the testimony of the two witnesses, and the fact that the switchblade used in the murder is not as unusual as the testimony indicates, producing an identical knife from his pocket.\\nJuror 8 proposes another vote by secret ballot – if the other jurors vote guilty unanimously, he will acquiesce, but if at least one votes \"not guilty\" they will continue deliberating. Only Juror 9 changes his vote, respecting Juror 8\\'s motives and feeling his points deserve further discussion.\\nAfter deliberating whether one witness actually heard the murder take place, Juror 5, who grew up in a slum, changes his vote. Juror 11, questioning whether the defendant would have fled the scene and returned three hours later to retrieve his knife, also changes his vote. Jurors 2 and 6 also vote \"not guilty\", tying the verdict at 6-6, after Juror 8 demonstrates the unlikelihood that one witness actually saw the boy flee the scene. The remaining jurors are intrigued when Juror 11 proves that although a psychiatric test stated that the boy had subconscious desires to kill, such tests only offer possible actions. Juror 7, impatient to attend a baseball game that night, changes his vote, but Juror 11 chastises him for changing his vote so casually and selfishly when the boy\\'s life is on the line. When pressed by Juror 11, Juror 7 eventually states that he doubts the boy is guilty.\\nJurors 12 and 1 change their votes, leaving the only dissenters: Jurors 3, 4, and 10. Outraged at the proceedings, Juror 10 goes on a bigoted diatribe against Hispanic immigrants \"outbreeding\" African-Americans. He attempts to leverage this with the other African-American jurors, offending the rest of the jury, until Juror 4 orders him to be quiet for the rest of the proceedings.\\nJuror 4 states that despite all the other evidence called into question, the testimony of the woman who saw the murder from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 changes his vote back to \"guilty\", making the vote 8–4 again. Juror 9, seeing Juror 4 rub his nose, irritated by his glasses, realizes that the witness had impressions on her nose, indicating that she wore glasses and likely was not wearing them when she saw the murder. Jurors 12 and 4 change their vote to \"not guilty\". Juror 10, who says he still thinks the defendant is guilty, bluntly admits to no longer caring about the verdict and votes for acquittal.\\nUndeterred, Juror 3 is forced to present his arguments again, and goes on a tirade, presenting the evidence in haphazard fashion and concluding with his disbelief that a son would kill his own father, mirroring his previous comments about his bad relationship with his own son. He begins to weep, and says he can feel the knife being plunged into his chest. Juror 8 gently points out that the boy is not his son, and Juror 4 gently persuades him to let the boy live. Juror 3 gives in, and the final vote is unanimous for acquittal.\\nThe jurors leave and the defendant is found not guilty off-screen, while Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat. Before departing the court, Jurors 8 (Davis) and 9 (McCardle) exchange names before parting ways.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', \"Schindler's List\": 'In Kraków during World War II, the Nazis force local Polish Jews into the overcrowded Kraków Ghetto. Oskar Schindler, a German Nazi Party member from Czechoslovakia, arrives in the city, hoping to make his fortune. He bribes Wehrmacht (German armed forces) and SS officials, acquiring a factory to produce enamelware. Schindler hires Itzhak Stern, a Jewish official with contacts among black marketeers and the Jewish business community; he handles administration and helps Schindler arrange financing. Stern ensures that as many Jewish workers as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort to prevent them from being taken by the SS to concentration camps or killed. Meanwhile, Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys his new wealth and status as an industrialist.\\nSS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth arrives in Kraków to oversee construction of the Płaszów concentration camp. When the camp is ready, he orders the ghetto liquidated: two thousand Jews are transported to Płaszów, and two thousand others are killed in the streets by the SS. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat who hides from the Nazis and later sees her body on a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and continues to enjoy SS support, mostly through bribery. Göth brutalizes his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa; the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler\\'s focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp at his factory.\\nAs the Germans begin losing the war, Göth is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at Płaszów to Auschwitz concentration camp. Schindler asks Göth for permission to move his workers to a munitions factory he plans to build in Brünnlitz near his hometown of Zwittau. Göth reluctantly agrees but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern prepare a list of people to be transferred to Brünnlitz instead of Auschwitz. The list eventually includes 1,100 names.\\nAs the Jewish workers are transported by train to Brünnlitz, the women and girls are mistakenly redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes Rudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz, for their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the production area without permission and encourages the Jews to observe the Sabbath. Over the next seven months, he spends his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies. Due to Schindler\\'s machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments. He runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders.\\nAs a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing Red Army to avoid capture. The SS guards at the factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to do so. Bidding farewell to his workers, he prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give him a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic quotation: \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire\". Schindler breaks down in tears, feeling he should have done more, and is comforted by the workers before he and his wife leave in their car. When the Schindlerjuden awaken the next morning, a mounted Soviet officer announces that they have been liberated but warns them not to go east because \"they hate you there\". The Jews then walk into the countryside.\\nAn epilogue reveals that Göth was convicted of crimes against humanity and executed via hanging, while Schindler\\'s marriage and businesses failed following the war. In the present, many of the surviving Schindlerjuden and the actors portraying them visit Schindler\\'s grave and place stones on its marker (a traditional Jewish sign of respect for the dead), after which Liam Neeson lays two roses.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King': \"The hobbit, Sméagol, is fishing with his cousin Déagol, who discovers the One Ring in the river.

Gandalf retrieves Saruman's palantír, and the group returns to Edoras to celebrate their victory at Helm's Deep. Pippin looks into the palantír, seeing Sauron and a burning tree. Gandalf deduces that the enemy plans to attack Gondor's capital Minas Tirith; he rides there to warn Gondor's corrupt steward Denethor. Pippin, who accompanies him, swears fealty to Denethor, whose now-dead heir Boromir had saved his life; on Gandalf's instruction, Pippin triggers the lighting of the beacons, which call for help from Rohan.\\nFrodo, who carries the Ring, and Sam continue their journey towards Mordor, unaware that Gollum, now their guide, plans to betray them and take the Ring for himself. The trio witnessed the Witch-king of Angmar, lord of the nine Nazgûl, setting off towards Gondor with his army of Orcs. Gollum conspires to frame Sam for eating food supplies and desiring the Ring; influenced by the growing power of the Ring, Frodo is taken in by the deception, and orders Sam to go home. Gollum then tricks Frodo into venturing into the lair of the giant spider Shelob. Frodo narrowly escapes and confronts Gollum, who falls down a chasm after a scuffle. Shelob discovers, paralyses, and binds Frodo, but is wounded and driven away by a returning Sam, who, mourning Frodo's apparent death, takes the Ring. Sam realises his mistake when a group of Orcs takes Frodo captive but manages to rescue Frodo as the Orcs fight among themselves. Now inside Mordor, the hobbits continue towards Mount Doom, their destination.\\nAs King Théoden gathers his army, Elrond tells Aragorn that Arwen is dying, having refused to leave Middle-earth. Elrond gives Aragorn Andúril, reforged from the shards of King Elendil's sword Narsil, and urges him to commit to claiming Gondor's throne, to which he is the heir. Joined by Legolas and Gimli, Aragorn travels the Paths of the Dead, and pledges to release the ghosts there from their curse should they come to Gondor's aid.

Théoden dies in his niece's arms. Aragorn then arrives with his Army of the Dead, who overcome Sauron's forces. Their oath is fulfilled, and the Dead are released from their curse. Aragorn decides to march on Mordor to distract Sauron from Frodo, now extremely weak, and Sam; all of Sauron's remaining forces march to meet Aragorn's diversion, allowing the hobbits to reach Mount Doom. Gollum, who survived his earlier fall, attacks them, but Frodo still manages to enter the mountain. There, he succumbs to the Ring's power, putting it on his finger, but Gollum manages to bite off his finger and reclaim it. They struggle together and stumble off the ledge. Frodo clings to it with one hand as remorse and guilt flood his mind in the wake of his succumbing to the ring when Sam's unwavering faith in his friend demands Frodo reach for Sam's stretched hand, saving Frodo's life. Gollum falls and dies; the Ring, which fell with him, disintegrates in the lava, causing Barad-dûr to crumble as The Eye of Sauron explodes, destroying the dark lord once and for all.

There are seven narrative sequences; the three primary storylines are preceded by intertitles:\\n\\n\"Prologue – The Diner\" (i)\\nPrelude to \"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace\\'s Wife\"\\n\"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace\\'s Wife\"\\nPrelude to \"The Gold Watch\" (a – flashback, b – present)\\n\"The Gold Watch\"\\n\"The Bonnie Situation\"\\n\"Epilogue – The Diner\" (ii)If the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5. Sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. According to Philip Parker, the structural form is \"an episodic narrative with circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the narrative\". Other analysts describe the structure as a \"circular narrative\".\\n\\n\\n=== Summary ===\\nHitmen Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett\\'s associates. He declaims a passage from the Bible, and he and Vincent kill Brett for trying to double-cross Marsellus.\\nAnother man bursts out of the bathroom and fires at them, but every shot misses; after briefly checking themselves for wounds, Jules and Vincent shoot him dead. While driving away with Brett\\'s associate Marvin, Jules professes that their survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes. Vincent accidentally fatally shoots Marvin in the face, and covering Vincent, Jules, and the car interior in blood in broad daylight. They hide the car at the home of Jules\\'s friend Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife, Bonnie, comes home. Marsellus sends a cleaner, Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to clean the car, hide the body in the trunk, dispose of their bloody clothes, and take the car to a junkyard.\\nAt a diner, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their \"miraculous\" survival at the apartment was a sign of divine intervention. While Vincent is in the bathroom, a couple, \"Pumpkin\" and \"Honey Bunny\", hold up the restaurant and demand Marsellus\\'s briefcase. Jules distracts Pumpkin with its contents, and then overpowers him and holds him at gunpoint; Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and points her gun at Jules. Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her, but Jules defuses the situation. He recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase in hand. They take the briefcase to Marsellus and wait while he bribes boxer Butch Coolidge to take a dive in his upcoming match.\\nThe next day, Vincent purchases heroin from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up and drives to meet Marsellus\\'s trophy wife, Mia, having agreed to escort her while Marsellus is out of town. They eat at Jack Rabbit Slim\\'s, a 1950s-themed restaurant, and participate in a twist contest, then return home. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin and snorts it, mistaking it for cocaine. She suffers an overdose; Vincent rushes her to Lance\\'s house, where they revive her with an injection of adrenaline into her heart. Vincent drops Mia off at her home, and the two agree never to tell Marsellus about the incident.\\nButch bets the bribe money on himself and double-crosses Marsellus, winning the bout but accidentally killing his opponent as well. Knowing that Marsellus will send hitmen after him, he prepares to flee with his girlfriend, Fabienne, but discovers she has forgotten to pack a gold watch passed down to him through his family. Returning to his apartment to retrieve it, he notices a gun on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. When Vincent exits the bathroom, Butch shoots him dead and departs.\\nWhen Marsellus spots Butch stopped at a traffic light, Butch rams his car into him, then gets hit by an oncoming vehicle, leaving both of them injured and dazed.

Maynard and his accomplice Zed take Marsellus into another room and begin to rape him, leaving the \"gimp\" – a silent figure in a bondage suit – to watch over Butch. Butch breaks loose and knocks the gimp unconscious. Instead of fleeing, he decides to save Marsellus, and arms himself with a katana from the pawnshop. He kills Maynard and frees Marsellus, who shoots Zed in the crotch with Maynard\\'s shotgun.

Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Elf Legolas, Dwarf Gimli, Boromir of Gondor, and Strider—who is actually Aragorn, Isildur\\'s heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo, now living in Rivendell, gives Frodo his sword Sting, and a chainmail shirt made of mithril.\\nThe Fellowship of the Ring makes for the Gap of Rohan, but discover it is being watched by Saruman\\'s spies. They instead set off over the mountain pass of Caradhras, but Saruman summons a storm that forces them to travel through the Mines of Moria, where a tentacled water beast blocks off the entrance with the Fellowship inside, giving them no choice but to journey to the exit on the other end. After finding the Dwarves of Moria dead, the Fellowship is attacked by Orcs and a cave troll. They hold them off but are confronted by Durin\\'s Bane: a Balrog residing within the mines. While the others escape, Gandalf fends off the Balrog and casts it into a vast chasm, but the Balrog drags Gandalf down into the darkness with him. The devastated Fellowship reaches Lothlórien, ruled by the Elf-queen Galadriel, who privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest and that one of the Fellowship will try to take the Ring. She also shows him a vision of the future in which Sauron succeeds in enslaving Middle-earth, including the Shire. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of Uruk-hai in Isengard to find and kill the Fellowship.\\nThe Fellowship travels by river to Parth Galen. Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who, as Lady Galadriel had warned, tries to take the Ring. Uruk-hai scouts then ambush the Fellowship, attempting to abduct the Hobbits.

He lives in Greenbow, Alabama, with his mother, who runs a boarding house and encourages him to live beyond his disabilities. Among their temporary tenants is a young Elvis Presley, who plays the guitar for Forrest and is inspired to incorporate the boy\\'s jerky leg and hip movements into his performances. On his first day of school, Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, and the two become best friends. Jenny is a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of her widowed, alcoholic father, but she is later removed from his custody.\\nBullied because of his leg braces and dimwittedness, Forrest flees from a group of children, but when his braces break off, he is revealed to be a fast runner. With this talent, he receives a football scholarship at the University of Alabama in 1962, where he is coached by Bear Bryant, becomes a top kick returner, is named to the All-American team, and meets president John F. Kennedy at the White House. In his first year at college, he witnesses Governor George Wallace\\'s Stand in the Schoolhouse Door and returns a dropped book to Vivian Malone Jones, one of the students admitted over state resistance. He visits Jenny at her college, where the two have an awkward sexual encounter.\\nAfter graduating from college in 1966, Forrest enlists in the U.S. Army. During basic training, he befriends a fellow soldier named Benjamin Buford Blue (nicknamed \"Bubba\"), who becomes a close friend and convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business with him after their service. While on leave, Forrest goes to Memphis, Tennessee, to see Jenny, who was expelled from college for posing in Playboy in her college sweater, and now works as a singer in a strip club. However, he embarrasses her by attacking some patrons who were harassing her, causing the two to part ways. Soon afterwards, Forrest and Bubba are sent to fight in Vietnam, serving with the 9th Infantry Division in the Mekong Delta region under Lieutenant Dan Taylor. After months of routine operations, their platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and several members of the platoon are killed in action, including Bubba. Forrest saves several others, including Lieutenant Dan, who loses both of his lower legs, while Forrest is shot \"in the buttocks.\" While recovering from his wound, Forrest develops a talent for ping pong. Dan is embittered from having his life saved as he had hoped to die in combat like his ancestors, and detests being handicapped. Forrest is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism by President Lyndon B. Johnson. \\nAt an anti-war March on the Pentagon rally, Forrest meets Abbie Hoffman, encounters a Black Panther group, and reunites with Jenny, who has become a drug-addicted hippie and anti-war activist, but the two are soon parted again when she leaves for San Francisco with her abusive boyfriend, Wesley, the president of SDS at Berkeley.

However, after their boat becomes the only one to survive Hurricane Carmen, they pull in vast amounts of shrimp and create the profitable Bubba Gump Shrimp Company. Lieutenant Dan acknowledges that Forrest saved him, however does not actually thank him for saving his life. Dan invests his money in early tech companies on the stock market, which Forrest mistakes for \"some kind of fruit company\", and the two become millionaires. Forrest gives half of his earnings to Bubba\\'s family for having inspired the shrimping venture. Forrest returns home to his mother and cares for her during her terminal illness from cancer.

One day, the two are walking, and come across the now-abandoned house of Jenny\\'s father, where Jenny, in a rage, throws all the rocks she can find at it, until she collapses in anguish. After some time, Forrest proposes to her, but she turns him down, much to Forrest\\'s dismay. That night, she confesses to Forrest that she does indeed love him. They make love, but Jenny leaves the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest, \"for no particular reason\", starts running and embarks on a cross-country marathon, becoming famous for another feat. Forrest starts to garner many followers, some of whom are struggling businessmen, whom he unwittingly gives inspiration. After a total of about three years and two-and-a half months running, Forrest decides to end the run, and returns to Greenbow, much to the surprise of his followers.\\nIn 1981, Forrest gets a letter from Jenny, asking him to visit her, which is why he has been waiting at the bus stop. An old lady informs him that the address is only five/six blocks away, and he rushes off. Forrest again reunites with Jenny, who has quit abusing drugs and turned her life around. Jenny then introduces him to her young son, Forrest Gump Jr., revealing that Forrest is his father. Initially shocked at the revelation, Forrest starts to bond with his son. Jenny later tells Forrest she is sick with \"some kind of virus\" and the doctors cannot do anything for her.

Their latest target, Saito, is impressed with Cobb\\'s ability to layer multiple dreams within each other. He offers to hire Cobb for the ostensibly impossible job of implanting an idea into a person\\'s subconscious; performing \"inception\" on Robert Fischer, the son of Saito\\'s competitor Maurice Fischer, with the idea to dissolve his father\\'s company. In return, Saito promises to clear Cobb\\'s criminal status, allowing him to return home to his children.\\nCobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: a forger named Eames, a chemist named Yusuf, and a college student named Ariadne. Ariadne is tasked with designing the dream\\'s architecture, something Cobb himself cannot do for fear of being sabotaged by his mind\\'s projection of his late wife Mal. Maurice Fischer dies, and the team sedates Robert Fischer into a three-layer shared dream on an airplane to America bought by Saito. Time on each layer runs slower than the layer above, with one member staying behind on each to perform a music-synchronized \"kick\" (using the French song \"Non, je ne regrette rien\") to awaken dreamers on all three levels simultaneously.\\nThe team abducts Robert in a city on the first level, but they are attacked by his trained subconscious projections. After Saito is wounded, Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally awaken dreamers, Yusuf\\'s sedatives will instead send them into \"Limbo\": a world of infinite subconscious. Eames impersonates Robert\\'s godfather, Peter Browning, to introduce the idea of an alternate will to dissolve the company.\\nCobb tells Ariadne that he and Mal entered Limbo while experimenting with dream-sharing, experiencing fifty years in one night due to the time dilation with reality. Mal refused to return to reality, and Cobb instead performed inception on her to convince her. After waking up, Mal still believed she was dreaming. Attempting to \"wake up\", she committed suicide and framed Cobb to force him to do the same. Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children behind.\\nYusuf drives the team around the first level as they are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb persuades Robert that he has been kidnapped by Browning to stop the dissolution and that Cobb is a defensive projection, leading Robert another third level deeper as part of a ruse to enter Robert\\'s subconscious.\\nIn the third level, the team infiltrates an alpine fortress with a projection of Maurice inside, where the inception itself can be performed.  However, Yusuf performs his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, forcing Arthur and Eames to improvise a new set of kicks synchronized with them hitting the water, by rigging an elevator and the fortress respectively with explosives. Mal then appears and kills Robert before he can be subjected to the inception and he and Saito are lost into Limbo, forcing Cobb and Ariadne to rescue them in time for Robert\\'s inception and Eames\\'s kick. Cobb makes peace with his part in causing Mal\\'s death. Ariadne kills Mal\\'s projection and wakes Robert up with a kick.\\nRevived into the third level, he discovers the planted idea: his dying father telling him to create something for himself. While Cobb searches for Saito in Limbo, the others ride the synced kicks back to reality. Cobb finds an aged Saito and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awaken on the plane, and Saito makes a phone call. Arriving at L.A., Cobb passes the immigration checkpoint and his father-in-law accompanies him to his home. Cobb uses Mal\\'s \"totem\" – a top that spins indefinitely in a dream – to test if he is indeed in the real world, but he chooses not to observe the result and instead joins his children.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back': 'Three years after the destruction of the Death Star, the Imperial fleet, led by Darth Vader, dispatches probe droids across the galaxy to find Princess Leia\\'s Rebel Alliance.

Before succumbing to hypothermia, the Force spirit of Luke\\'s deceased mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, instructs him to go to the swamp planet Dagobah to train as a Jedi Knight under the Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo discovers Luke and insulates him against the weather inside his deceased tauntaun mount until they are rescued the next morning.\\nAlerted to the Rebels\\' location, the Empire launches a large-scale attack using AT-AT walkers to capture the base, forcing the Rebels to evacuate.

She flees, pursued by the police and a group of suited Agents capable of similar superhuman feats. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes.\\nComputer programmer Thomas Anderson, known by his hacking alias \"Neo\", is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix\". Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named Morpheus has the answers Neo seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by Agent Smith, arrives at Neo\\'s workplace in search of him. Though Morpheus attempts to guide Neo to safety, Neo surrenders rather than risk a dangerous escape. The Agents offer to erase Neo\\'s criminal record in exchange for his help with locating Morpheus, who they claim is a terrorist. When Neo refuses to cooperate, they fuse his mouth shut, pin him down, and implant a robotic \"bug\" in his abdomen. Neo wakes up from what he believes to be a nightmare. Soon after, Neo is taken by Trinity to meet Morpheus, and she removes the bug from Neo.\\nMorpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills: red to reveal the truth about the Matrix, or blue to make Neo forget everything and return to his former life. Neo takes the red pill, and his reality begins to distort, awakening in a liquid-filled pod among countless other pods, containing other humans. He is then brought aboard Morpheus\\'s flying ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the situation: In the early 21st century, a war broke out between humanity and intelligent machines. After humans blocked the machines\\' access to solar energy, the machines responded by enslaving humankind and harvesting their bioelectric power while keeping their minds pacified in the Matrix, a shared simulated reality modeled on the world as it was in 1999. In the years following, the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion.\\nMorpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix\\'s simulated nature allows them to bend its physical laws. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix kills the physical body too and explains that the Agents are sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels eliminate rebels in the real world. Neo\\'s prowess during virtual training cements Morpheus\\'s belief that Neo is \"the One\", a human prophesied to free humankind. The group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle, a prophet-like program who predicted that the One would emerge. She implies to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus\\'s life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, Agents and police ambush the group, tipped off by Cypher, a disgruntled crew member who has betrayed Morpheus in exchange for a deal to be plugged back into the Matrix to live a comfortable life.\\nTo buy time for the others, Morpheus fights Smith and is captured. Cypher exits the Matrix and murders the other crew members as they lie unconscious. Before Cypher can kill Neo and Trinity, crew member Tank regains consciousness and kills him before pulling Neo and Trinity from the Matrix. The Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, which would allow them to destroy it. Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as the Oracle prophesied; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to those of the Agents.\\nAfter Morpheus and Trinity safely exit the Matrix, Smith ambushes and appears to kill Neo. While a group of Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar, Trinity confesses her love for Neo and says the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One. Neo is revived, with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix; he easily defeats Smith, prompting the other Agents to flee and he leaves the Matrix just as the ship\\'s electromagnetic pulse disables the Sentinels. Back in the Matrix, Neo makes a telephone call, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible.\" He hangs up and flies away.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Goodfellas': 'In 1955, youngster Henry Hill becomes enamored by the criminal life and Mafia presence in his working class Italian-American neighborhood in Brooklyn.

On Monday, Somerset and Mills investigate an obese man who was forced to eat until his stomach burst, killing him. The detectives find the word \"gluttony\" written on a wall. Somerset, considering the case too extreme for his last investigation, asks to be reassigned to another case but his request is denied. The following day, another victim, who had been forced to cut one pound (0.45 kg) of flesh from his body is found; the crime scene is marked \"greed.\" Clues at the scene lead Somerset and Mills to the sloth victim, a drug-dealing pederast who they find emaciated and restrained to a bed. Photographs reveal the victim was restrained for exactly one year. Somerset surmises the murders are based on the Christian concept of the seven deadly sins.\\nTracy invites Somerset to share supper with her and Mills, helping the detectives overcome their mutual hostility. On Friday, Tracy meets privately with Somerset because she has no other acquaintances in the city. She reveals her unhappiness at moving there, especially after learning she is pregnant, and believes the city is an unfit place to raise a child. Somerset sympathizes with Tracy, having persuaded his former girlfriend to abort their child for similar reasons and regretting it ever since; he advises Tracy to inform Mills only if she intends to keep the child.\\nA comment by Mills inspires Somerset to research libraries for anyone checking out books based on the seven deadly sins, leading the pair to the apartment of John Doe. Doe unexpectedly returns home and is pursued by Mills, who is incapacitated after Doe strikes him with a tire iron. Doe momentarily holds Mills at gunpoint but soon flees. The police investigate Doe\\'s apartment, finding a large amount of cash, hundreds of notebooks revealing Doe\\'s psychopathy, and photographs of some of his victims; the cache includes images of Somerset and Mills by a person they believed was an intrusive journalist at the sloth crime scene. Doe calls the apartment and speaks of his admiration for Mills.\\nOn Saturday, Somerset and Mills investigate the fourth victim, lust, a prostitute who has been raped with a custom-made, bladed strap-on by a man held at gunpoint. The following day, the pride victim is found; she is a model whom Doe facially disfigured and died by suicide rather than live without her beauty. As Somerset and Mills return to the police station, Doe arrives and surrenders himself. He threatens to plead insanity at his trial, potentially escaping punishment, unless Mills and Somerset escort him to an undisclosed location where they will find the envy and wrath victims. During the drive, Doe says he believes God has chosen him to send a message about the ubiquity of, and apathy toward, sin. Doe has no remorse for his victims, believing the shocking murders will force society to pay him attention.\\nDoe leads the detectives to a remote location, where a delivery van approaches. Somerset intercepts the vehicle, whose driver was instructed to deliver to Mills a package at this specific time. Somerset is horrified at the package\\'s contents and tells Mills to put down his gun. Doe reveals he himself represents envy because he envied Mills\\' life with Tracy, and implies the package contains her severed head. He urges Mills to become wrath, telling him Tracy begged for her life and that of her unborn child, and takes pleasure in realizing Mills was unaware of the pregnancy. Despite Somerset\\'s pleas, Mills, distraught and enraged, shoots Doe dead, completing Doe\\'s plan. Police remove the catatonic Mills, and Somerset tells his captain he will \"be around.\" Somerset says in voiceover: \"Ernest Hemingway once wrote: \\'The world is a fine place, and worth fighting for.\\' I agree with the second part.\"\\n\\n\\n== Cast', \"It's a Wonderful Life\": 'On Christmas Eve 1945, in Bedford Falls, New York, George Bailey contemplates suicide. The prayers of his family and friends reach Heaven, where guardian angel second class Clarence Odbody is assigned to save George in order to earn his wings. Clarence is shown flashbacks of George\\'s life. He watches 12-year-old George rescue his younger brother Harry from drowning, leaving George deaf in his left ear.  George later prevents the pharmacist, Mr. Gower, from accidentally poisoning a customer\\'s prescription.\\nIn 1928, George plans a world tour before college. He is reintroduced to Mary Hatch, who has been enamored with him since childhood. When his father dies suddenly, George postpones his travel to settle the family business, Bailey Brothers Building and Loan. Avaricious board member Henry Potter, who controls most of the town, seeks to dissolve it, but the board votes to keep the Building and Loan open if George runs it. George acquiesces and works alongside his uncle Billy, giving his tuition savings to Harry with the understanding that Harry will run the business when he graduates.\\nHarry returns from college married and with a job offer from his father-in-law, and George resigns himself to running the Building and Loan. George and Mary rekindle their relationship and wed. They witness a run on the bank and use their honeymoon savings to keep the Building and Loan solvent. Under George, the company establishes Bailey Park, a housing development surpassing Potter\\'s overpriced slums. Potter entices George with a $20,000/year job, but realizing that Potter\\'s true intention is to close the Building and Loan, George rebuffs him.\\nOn Christmas Eve 1945, the town prepares a hero\\'s welcome for Harry, who, as a U.S. Navy fighter pilot, was awarded the Medal of Honor for preventing a kamikaze attack on a troop transport. Billy goes to Potter\\'s bank to deposit $8,000 of the Building and Loan\\'s money. He taunts Potter with a newspaper headline about Harry, then absentmindedly wraps the cash in Potter\\'s newspaper. Potter finds and keeps the money, while Billy cannot recall how he misplaced it. With a bank examiner reviewing the company\\'s records, George realizes scandal and criminal charges will follow. Fruitlessly retracing Billy\\'s steps, George berates him and takes out his frustration on Mary and their children. George appeals to Potter for a loan, offering his life insurance policy as collateral. Potter scoffs that George is worth more dead than alive, refuses to help, and phones the police.\\nGeorge flees Potter\\'s office, gets drunk at a bar, and prays for help. Contemplating suicide, he goes to a nearby bridge. However, before George can jump, Clarence dives into the freezing river, and George rescues him. When George wishes he had never been born, Clarence shows George a timeline in which he never existed. Bedford Falls is now Pottersville, an unsavory town occupied by sleazy entertainment venues, crime, and callous people. Mr. Gower was imprisoned for manslaughter because George was not there to stop him from poisoning the customer. George\\'s mother does not know him. Uncle Billy was institutionalized after the Building and Loan failed. Bailey Park is a cemetery, where George discovers Harry\\'s grave. Without George, Harry drowned as a child, and without Harry to save them, the troops aboard the transport ship were killed. George finds Mary, now a spinster, and when he grabs her and claims to be her husband, she screams and runs. \\nGeorge flees back to the bridge and begs Clarence for his life back. The original reality is restored, and a grateful George rushes home to await his arrest. Meanwhile, Mary and Billy have rallied the townspeople, who come into the Bailey home and donate more than enough to cover the missing money. Harry arrives and toasts George as \"the richest man in town\". Among the donations George finds a copy of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, a gift from Clarence and inscribed, \"Remember, no man is a failure who has friends. Thanks for the wings!\" When a bell on the Christmas tree rings, George\\'s youngest daughter, Zuzu, explains that \"every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.\" George looks upward smiling and says, \"Atta boy, Clarence!\"\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Seven Samurai': 'In 1586, a bandit gang discusses raiding a mountain village, but their chief decides to wait until after the harvest. The villagers overhear this and turn to Gisaku, the village elder and miller, who declares that they should hire samurai to protect them. Since they have no money and can only offer food as payment, Gisaku advises them to find hungry samurai.\\nSeveral villagers go into town and eventually find Kambei, an aging but experienced rōnin, whom they see rescuing a young boy held hostage by a cornered thief. A young samurai named Katsushirō asks to become Kambei\\'s disciple. The villagers ask for Kambei\\'s help, and though initially reluctant, he agrees. He then recruits his old comrade-in-arms Shichirōji, along with Gorobei, Heihachi, and Kyūzō, a taciturn master swordsman whom Katsushirō regards with awe. Kikuchiyo, a wild and eccentric samurai-poser, is eventually accepted as well after attempts to drive him away fail.\\nArriving at the village, the samurai and farmers slowly begin to trust each other. Katsushirō meets Shino, a farmer\\'s daughter disguised as a boy by her father, and sleeps with her despite knowing the difference in their social classes prohibits it. Later, the samurai are angered when Kikuchiyo brings them armor and weapons, which the villagers acquired by killing other samurai injured or fleeing from battle. Kikuchiyo angrily retorts that samurai are responsible for much of the suffering farmers endure, revealing he is an orphaned farmer\\'s son. The samurai\\'s anger turns to shame.\\nKambei arms the villagers with bamboo spears and organizes them into squads to prepare defenses and train. Three bandit scouts are spotted; two are killed, while the survivor reveals the location of their encampment before being slain by the villagers. The samurai burn down the camp in a pre-emptive strike. Rikichi, a troubled villager aiding the samurai, breaks down when he sees his wife, who was kidnapped and made a concubine during a previous raid. Upon seeing Rikichi, she runs back into a burning hut to her death.  Heihachi is killed by a gunshot while stopping Rikichi from pursuing her. At Heihachi\\'s funeral, the saddened villagers are inspired by Kikuchiyo, who raises a banner Heihachi made to represent the six samurai, Kikuchiyo, and the village.\\nWhen the bandits finally arrive, they are confounded by the new fortifications, which include a moat and high wooden fences. They burn the village\\'s outlying houses, including Gisaku\\'s mill. Gisaku\\'s family tries to save him when he refuses to abandon it, but all perish except a baby rescued by Kikuchiyo. The bandits then besiege the village, but many are killed as the defenders thwart every attack.\\nThe bandits possess three matchlock muskets. Kyūzō ventures out alone and captures one; an envious Kikuchiyo abandons his squad to bring back another. However, his absence allows a handful of bandits to infiltrate his post and kill several farmers, and Gorobei is slain defending his position. That night, Kambei predicts that the bandits will make one final assault due to their dwindling numbers.\\nMeanwhile, Katsushirō and Shino\\'s relationship is discovered by her father, who is enraged that her virginity has been taken and beats her. Kambei and the villagers intervene; Shichirōji reasons that such behavior is normal before battle and that they should be forgiven.\\nThe next morning, the defenders allow the remaining bandits to enter the village and then ambush them. As the battle nears its end, the bandit chief hides in the women\\'s hut and shoots Kyūzō dead with his musket. An enraged Kikuchiyo charges in and is shot as well, but kills the chief before dying. The remaining outlaws are slain.\\nAfterward, Kambei, Katsushirō and Shichirōji stand in front of the funeral mounds of their comrades, watching the joyful villagers sing while planting their crops. Katsushirō and Shino meet one last time, but Shino walks past him after a moment to join in the planting indicating that their relationship has ended. Kambei says to Shichirōji that it is another pyrrhic victory for the samurai: \"The victory belongs to those peasants.

Crawford secretly hopes to get insights into a psychopathic serial killer known as \"Buffalo Bill,\" who kills overweight women and skins them.\\nStarling meets Lecter in his cell at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Although initially courteous, Lecter rebuffs her, deducing Crawford\\'s true motive. As she is leaving, another prisoner, Miggs, flings his semen at her, angering Lecter, who changes his mind and provides Starling a clue. The clue leads to a jar holding a man\\'s severed head. The man is linked to Buffalo Bill, and Lecter offers to profile the killer on the condition that he is transferred away from Dr. Frederick Chilton, whom he detests. Meanwhile, Lecter influences Miggs into swallowing his own tongue and committing suicide, presumably to avenge his revolting action toward Starling, and another victim is found, with a death\\'s head moth lodged in her throat.\\nIn Tennessee, Buffalo Bill abducts Catherine Martin, the daughter of a U.S. senator. Crawford authorizes Starling to offer Lecter a fake deal, promising a prison transfer if he helps them capture Buffalo Bill in time to rescue Catherine. Instead, Lecter demands a quid pro quo, offering clues in exchange for personal information about Starling; she agrees. Chilton exposes Starling\\'s deceit and offers Lecter a new deal. Lecter agrees and is flown to Memphis, where he gives Senator Martin accurate information on Buffalo Bill\\'s appearance but falsely identifies him as \"Louis Friend.\"\\nStarling figures out the name is an anagram of \"iron sulfide\", a.k.a. \"fool\\'s gold\". She visits Lecter, now imprisoned in Tennessee. She describes a traumatic childhood incident wherein she heard lambs screaming at slaughter in the barn but could not save them. Lecter speculates that she hopes saving Catherine will end the recurring nightmares she has from this event. Satisfied, he returns the case files to her. That evening, Lecter brutally kills his two guards and escapes from his cell.\\nWith her notes from Lecter, Starling figures out that Buffalo Bill knew his first victim: Frederika Bimmel. She travels to Bimmel\\'s Ohio hometown and discovers that she and Buffalo Bill were both tailors. In Bimmel\\'s room, she finds evidence that reveals Buffalo Bill is making a suit with human skin. The culprit is a man named Jame Gumb who believes he is transsexual but was deemed too violent to apply for a sex-change operation. Crawford and an FBI Hostage Rescue Team storm Gumb\\'s address in Illinois but find the house empty. Meanwhile, Starling follows a lead that takes her to the house of Bimmel\\'s former client. There, she meets the real Jame Gumb, realizing he is Buffalo Bill after spotting a death\\'s head moth. She pursues him and finds Catherine trapped in a dry well in the cavernous basement. Gumb stalks Starling with night-vision goggles but reveals himself by cocking his revolver; she reacts quickly and shoots him dead.\\nAt the FBI Academy graduation party, Starling receives a phone call from Lecter, who is in the Bahamas at a Bimini airport. He assures her that he has no intention of pursuing her and requests that she return the favor, which she says she cannot. He hangs up, stating that he is \"having an old friend for dinner\" as he trails a newly-arrived Chilton into the crowd.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Interstellar': 'In 2067, humanity is facing extinction following a global famine caused by ecocide. As a result, ex-NASA pilot, Joseph Cooper, is forced to work as a farmer, with his son Tom, daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald.\\nAfter odd occurrences in her room, Murph arrives at the conclusion that a ghost, trapped in her bookshelf, is trying to communicate the word \\'stay\\' to her. Cooper seeks a scientific explanation for the gravitational anomaly and deduces a pattern that resolves into GPS coordinates. Following the address, he and Murph arrive at a secret NASA facility, headed by Professor Brand. NASA is distrusting of Cooper initially, but Brand enlists Cooper\\'s help for their mission, believing him to have been led there by the same entity - a supernatural, extra-terrestrial \"them\" - who decades ago placed a mysterious wormhole, close to humanity\\'s reach near the planet Saturn. NASA\\'s objective is to follow up on earlier missions through the wormhole and find an exoplanet suited to support human life. Their \"Plan A\" is to eventually transport people off the dying Earth to the other planet (using a yet-to-be-solved gravity equation), failing which, \"Plan B\" would use embryos to start a new extra-terrestrial colony, letting Earth\\'s original population perish. \\nBelieving Plan A will save Murph\\'s generation, Cooper bids farewell to his family and embarks on the mission aboard the spacecraft Endurance, along with a crew of three scientists: Romilly, Doyle, and Brand’s daughter Amelia, and two robot assistants TARS and CASE. After reaching their destination, the crew investigates three planets orbiting a supermassive black hole, Gargantua, each previously checked by a NASA scientist-explorer. Romilly remains in orbit to study Gargantua while the others take a Ranger craft to the first planet, an ocean world of shallow water assigned to explorer Laura Miller. Upon arriving at Miller\\'s beacon and finding debris, they realize she was killed by colossal tidal waves generated by Gargantua\\'s gravity. Doyle is swept away by a huge wave, and Cooper and Amelia narrowly escape the next. They return to the Endurance after only a couple of hours in their perspective, yet 23 years have passed aboard Endurance due to the time dilation caused by Gargantua\\'s gravity. Back on Earth, Murph has become a scientist and begun working with the elder Brand.\\nThe second planet\\'s mission fails as well, as the crew realizes that the planet\\'s explorer, Mann, whom they awaken from cryostasis, had been transmitting false signals about the ice world\\'s habitability so that someone would rescue him. Mann turns on the crew, first attempting to kill Cooper, then hijacking a Ranger so that he can dock with the Endurance and take control. Romilly is killed by an explosion planted by Mann at the base, and Mann is himself killed after failing to properly dock in space. Cooper and Amelia approach the damaged Endurance in a Lander, and regain control of the spacecraft. On Earth, a dying Brand confesses to Murph that he lied about the viability of Plan A, dooming Earth\\'s population knowingly. He believed that his gravity equation \\nwas unsolvable, as it lacked vital information able to be obtained only from inside a black hole\\'s singularity. Murph is distraught that her father left her to die, but resolves to find a solution to Brand\\'s work.\\nMeanwhile, Cooper devises a plan to initiate a slingshot maneuver around Gargantua, propelling the Endurance onwards to the third and final planet, assigned to Dr. Wolf Edmunds. To shed extra weight, he sacrifices himself and TARS by detaching from the spacecraft and falling into the black hole, setting up Amelia to safely reach Edmunds\\' planet. Falling past the event horizon, Cooper finds himself inside a four-dimensional tesseract where time is physically presented. Seeing past moments from Murph\\'s childhood bedroom, he tries to contact her by manipulating items in the room with gravity. Cooper deduces this construct has been created by future humans able to interact with five dimensions - \"them\" - in order for him to send messages he received in the past, such as the word \\'stay\\'. With TARS\\'s help, Cooper relays the information Murph needs to solve the gravity equation in the form of Morse code on her watch. The tesseract closes, and he and TARS are returned to the orbit of Saturn. Cooper is rescued and brought to an O\\'Neill Cylinder, where he tearfully reunites with an elderly Murph, who has used the gravity equation to accomplish Plan A and enable humanity\\'s exodus from Earth. Nearing death, she advises him to seek out Amelia. Cooper and TARS set off again to reunite with Amelia. On Edmunds\\' planet, Amelia buries the deceased Edmunds before removing her helmet to breathe.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Saving Private Ryan': 'On June 6, 1944, the U.S. Army lands at Omaha Beach as part of the Normandy invasion, incurring major losses against the artillery and mortar fire of the heavily fortified German forces. Initially dazed by the chaotic battle, 2nd Ranger Battalion Captain John H. Miller takes command of a surviving group and leads a successful infiltration behind German lines to secure victory. The United States Department of War receives communication that three of four Ryan brothers have been killed in action; the last, James Francis Ryan of the 101st Airborne Division, is listed as missing. General of the Army George C. Marshall orders that Ryan be found and sent home, to spare his family the loss of all its sons. Miller is tasked with recovering Ryan and assembles a detachment of soldiers to accompany him: Mike Horvath, Richard Reiben, Adrian Caparzo, Stanley Mellish, Daniel Jackson, Irwin Wade, and interpreter Timothy Upham, who lacks any combat experience.\\nThe group tracks Ryan to the town of Neuville-au-Plain, where Caparzo is killed by a German sniper while trying to rescue a young girl. Mourning their friend, the men grow resentful at being forced to risk their lives for one man. They later find James Frederick Ryan, but realize he is the wrong man with a similar name. That evening, the men rest in a chapel, where Miller tells Horvath that his hands began uncontrollably shaking after he joined the war. The men travel to a rallying point where the 101st Airborne might be after landing off course, where they find masses of wounded and displaced soldiers. Wade admonishes Reiben, Mellish, and Jackson for callously searching through a pile of deceased soldiers\\' dog tags in front of passing troops, hoping to find Ryan\\'s among them and conclude their mission. Remorseful for ignoring their behavior, Miller shouts for anyone that knows Ryan; one deafened soldier tells him that Ryan was reassigned to defend a vital bridge in the town of Ramelle.\\nOn the way, Miller decides to neutralize a German gun nest they discover, against the advice of his men, and although they are successful, Wade is killed. The men decide to execute a surrendered German soldier in revenge, but Upham intervenes, arguing that they should follow the rules of war. Miller releases the soldier, nicknamed \"Steamboat Willie\", ordering that he surrender to the next Allied patrol. Frustrated, Reiben threatens to desert, leading to a standoff between the men that Miller defuses by revealing his civilian background as a teacher and baseball coach, which he has always refused to disclose. Miller muses that people often guessed his career before he became a soldier, while his men could not, implying that war has changed him, and worries whether he is still the man he was or that his wife will recognize him.\\nIn Ramelle, Miller\\'s detachment finds Ryan and informs him of their mission, but Ryan refuses to abandon his post or his fellow soldiers, believing he does not deserve to go home more than anyone else. Horvath convinces Miller that saving Ryan might be the only truly decent thing they can accomplish during the war. Miller takes command of Ryan\\'s unofficial group as the only officer present and prepares the soldiers for a German assault. Jackson and Horvath are killed, and Upham stands paralyzed with fear as Mellish is stabbed to death. Steamboat Willie returns and shoots Miller before reinforcements arrive to defeat the Germans. Upham confronts Willie, who attempts to surrender again, and kills him. Upham and Reiben observe as the mortally wounded Miller tells Ryan to earn the sacrifices made to send him home.\\nDecades later, an elderly Ryan and his family visit Miller\\'s grave at the Normandy Cemetery. Ryan expresses that he remembers Miller\\'s words every day, lived his life the best he could, and hopes he has earned their sacrifices.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'City of God': 'The film begins in medias res with an armed gang chasing after an escaped chicken in a favela called the Cidade de Deus (\"City of God\").

Guido is comical and sharp and falls in love with a Gentile girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to Rodolfo, a rich but arrogant local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many \"coincidental\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. \\nFinally, Dora sees Guido\\'s affection and promise and gives in, against her better judgment. He steals the lady from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fiancé and mother. They are later married, have a son Giosuè, and run a bookstore.\\nDuring World War II, in 1944 when Northern Italy is occupied by Nazi Germany, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosuè are seized on Giosuè\\'s birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train bound for a concentration camp. After confronting a guard about her husband and son and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. \\nHowever, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido do not see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp\\'s loudspeaker to send messages—symbolic or literal—to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is murdered in a gas chamber shortly after their arrival. Giosuè narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers and were told they were showers.\\nIn the camp, Guido hides the true situation from his son. Guido tells Giosuè that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Giosuè is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue. \\nAt one point Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German officers and their families to show Giosuè that other children are hiding as part of the game, and he also takes advantage of a German nanny thinking Giosuè is one of her charges in order to feed him as Guido serves the German officers. Guido and Giosuè are almost found out to be prisoners by another server until Guido is found teaching all of the German children how to say \"Thank you\" in Italian, effectively providing a ruse.\\nGuido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the Allied forces approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is caught by a German soldier. An officer orders Guido to be executed and Guido is led off by the soldier. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosuè one last time and winks, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot and left for dead in an alleyway. \\nThe next morning, Giosuè emerges from the sweat-box, just as a U.S. Army unit led by a Sherman tank arrives and the camp is liberated. Giosuè is overjoyed about winning the game (unaware that his father is dead), thinking that he won the tank, and an American soldier allows Giosuè to ride on the tank. \\nWhile traveling to safety, Giosuè soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with his mother.

The officers are forced to deal with psychotic new inmate William \"Wild Bill\" Wharton, who frequently causes trouble by assaulting the officers and racially abusing John, forcing them to restrain him in the block\\'s padded cell on more than one occasion.\\nAfter John heals Paul\\'s severe bladder infection by touching him, and later resurrects Mr. Jingles, Paul gradually realizes that John possesses a supernatural ability to heal others. Paul doubts whether someone with the power to perform divine miracles is truly guilty of the crime.\\nIn exchange for resigning from the penitentiary and accepting a job at an insane asylum, Percy is allowed to oversee Del\\'s execution. At the execution, Percy deliberately avoids soaking the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del\\'s head, leading to Del suffering a gruesome and agonizing death by burning, with John forced to feel Del\\'s pain as well. Paul and the other officers punish Percy by forcing him to spend a night in the padded cell. While Percy is locked away, they drug Wharton and secretly smuggle John out of the prison so that he can use his powers to heal Warden Moores\\' wife Melinda of a brain tumor, saving her life. After Percy is released from the padded room, the others threaten to report him for his various acts of misconduct if his behavior continues.\\nJohn uses his powers to \"release\" Melinda\\'s affliction into Percy\\'s brain, causing Percy to shoot Wharton dead. Soon after, John reveals in a vision to Paul that Wharton was the true culprit of the crimes for which he was wrongfully condemned, releasing his supernatural energy into Paul in the process. Having gone into a catatonic state, Percy is committed to the same insane asylum where he had planned to work after resigning from the prison.\\nAfter realizing that John is innocent, Paul becomes distraught at the thought of executing him and offers to let him go free. John tells Paul that the execution would be an act of mercy, as he views the world as a cruel place and is in constant pain from the suffering that people inflict upon each other. Mentioning that he has never seen a movie before, John watches Top Hat with the other officers as his last request. As John is taken to be executed, he is mercilessly scorned by the parents of the two girls who still believe him to be guilty. He asks not to have a hood placed over his head as he is afraid of the dark. Paul, Brutal, and the officers watch in great sadness, visibly holding back tears as John is executed. \\nBack in present day, Paul tells Elaine that John\\'s execution was the last that he and Brutal witnessed, as they both subsequently resigned from the prison and took jobs in the juvenile system. Paul reveals to Elaine that Mr. Jingles is still alive, having been blessed with a supernaturally long life thanks to John\\'s healing touch. He also reveals that he is now 108 years old; he was 44 when John was executed. While Elaine sees Paul\\'s long life as another of John\\'s miracles, Paul speculates that he may have been condemned to linger on Earth and outlive all of his loved ones as a divine punishment for John\\'s execution. Paul later attends Elaine\\'s funeral and muses on how much longer he has left to live, saying, \"We each owe a death. There are no exceptions. But, oh, God... sometimes, the Green Mile seems so long.\"\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope': 'Amid a galactic civil war, Rebel Alliance spies have stolen plans  to the tyrannical Galactic Empire\\'s Death Star, a massive space station capable of destroying entire planets. Imperial Senator Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, secretly one of the Rebellion\\'s leaders, has obtained its schematics, but her ship is intercepted by an Imperial Star Destroyer under the command of the ruthless Darth Vader. Before she is captured, Leia hides the plans in the memory system of astromech droid R2-D2, who flees in an escape pod to the nearby desert planet Tatooine alongside his companion, protocol droid C-3PO.\\nThe droids are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew Luke Skywalker. While Luke is cleaning R2-D2, he discovers a holographic recording of Leia requesting help from one Obi-Wan Kenobi. Later, R2-D2 is missing, and while searching for him, Luke is attacked by scavenging Sand People. He is rescued by elderly hermit Obi-Wan Kenobi, who tells Luke of his days as one of the Jedi Knights, former peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic, who drew mystical abilities from a metaphysical energy field known as \"the Force\", but were ultimately hunted to near-extinction by the Empire. Luke learns that his father fought alongside Obi-Wan as a Jedi Knight during the Clone Wars until Vader, Obi-Wan\\'s former pupil, turned to the dark side of the Force and murdered him. Obi-Wan offers Luke his father\\'s old lightsaber, the signature weapon of Jedi Knights.\\nR2-D2 plays Leia\\'s full message, in which she begs Obi-Wan to take the Death Star plans to Alderaan and give them to her father, a fellow veteran, for analysis. Although Luke initially declines Obi-Wan\\'s offer to accompany him to Alderaan and learn the ways of the Force, he is left with no choice after discovering that Imperial stormtroopers have killed his aunt and uncle and destroyed their farm in their search for the droids. Traveling to a cantina in Mos Eisley to search for transport, Luke and Obi-Wan hire Han Solo, a smuggler indebted to local mobster Jabba the Hutt. Pursued by stormtroopers, Obi-Wan, Luke, R2-D2, and C-3PO flee Tatooine with Han and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca on their ship, the Millennium Falcon.\\nBefore the Falcon can reach Alderaan, Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin destroys the planet after interrogating Leia for the location of the Rebel Alliance\\'s base.

As Obi-Wan leaves to disable the tractor beam, Luke persuades Han and Chewbacca to help him rescue Leia after discovering that she is scheduled to be executed. After disabling the tractor beam, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself in a lightsaber duel against Vader, allowing the rest of the group to escape the Death Star with Leia. Using a tracking device, the Empire tracks the Falcon to the hidden Rebel base on Yavin IV.\\nThe schematics reveal a hidden weakness in the Death Star\\'s thermal exhaust port, which could allow the Rebels to trigger a chain reaction in its main reactor with a precise proton torpedo strike. Han leaves the Rebels to pay off Jabba, after collecting his reward for rescuing Leia. Luke joins their X-wing starfighter squadron in a desperate attack against the approaching Death Star. In the ensuing battle, the Rebels suffer heavy losses as Vader leads a squadron of TIE fighters against them. Han and Chewbacca unexpectedly return to aid them in the Falcon, and knock Vader\\'s ship off course before he can shoot Luke down. Guided by the voice of Obi-Wan\\'s spirit, Luke uses the Force to aim his torpedoes into the exhaust port, destroying the Death Star moments before it fires on the Rebel base.

Skynet sends the T-1000—an advanced, prototype, shape-shifting Terminator made of virtually indestructible liquid metal—back in time to kill resistance leader John Connor when he is a child. To protect Connor, the resistance sends back a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator, a less-advanced metal endoskeleton covered in synthetic flesh.\\nIn 1995 Los Angeles, John\\'s mother Sarah is incarcerated in Pescadero State Hospital for her violent efforts to prevent \"Judgment Day\"—the prophesied events of August 29, 1997, when Skynet will gain sentience and, in response to its creators\\' attempts to deactivate it, incite a nuclear holocaust. John, living with foster parents, considers Sarah delusional and resents her efforts to prepare him for his future role. The T-1000 locates John in a shopping mall, but the T-800 intervenes, coming to John\\'s aid and enabling his escape. John calls to warn his foster parents, but the T-800 deduces the T-1000 has already killed them. Realizing the T-800 is programmed to obey him, John forbids it from killing people and orders it to save Sarah from the T-1000. \\nThe T-800 and John intercept Sarah during an escape attempt but Sarah flees in horror because the T-800 resembles the Terminator sent to kill her in 1984. John and the T-800 persuade her to join them, and they escape the pursuing T-1000. Although distrustful of the T-800, Sarah uses its knowledge of the future to learn that a revolutionary microprocessor, being developed by Cyberdyne engineer Miles Dyson, will be crucial to Skynet\\'s creation. Over the course of their journey, Sarah sees the T-800 serving as a friend and father figure to John, who teaches it catchphrases and hand signs while encouraging it to become more human-like. \\nSarah plans to escape to Mexico with John, but a nightmare about Judgment Day convinces her to kill Dyson. She attacks Dyson in his home but realizes she cannot kill a person and relents. John arrives and reconciles with Sarah while the T-800 convinces Dyson of the future consequences of his work. Dyson reveals his research has been reverse engineered from the CPU and severed arm of the 1984 Terminator. Believing his work must be destroyed, Dyson aids Sarah, John, and the T-800 to break into Cyberdyne, retrieve the CPU and the arm, and set explosives to destroy the lab. The police assault the building and fatally shoot Dyson, but he detonates the explosives as he dies. The T-1000 pursues the surviving trio, cornering them in a steel mill.\\nSarah and John split up to escape while the T-1000 mangles the T-800 and briefly deactivates it by destroying its power source. The T-1000 assumes Sarah\\'s appearance to lure out John but Sarah intervenes and, along with the reactivated T-800, pushes it into a vat of molten steel, where it disintegrates. The T-800 explains it must also be destroyed to prevent it from serving as a foundation for Skynet. Despite John\\'s tearful protests, the T-800 persuades him its destruction is the only way to protect their future. Sarah shakes the T-800\\'s hand and, having come to respect it, lowers it into the vat. The T-800 gives John a thumbs-up as it is incinerated. As Sarah drives down a highway with John, she reflects on her renewed hope for an unknown future, musing if the T-800 could learn the value of life, so can humanity.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Back to the Future': 'In 1985, teenager Marty McFly lives in Hill Valley, California, with his depressed alcoholic mother, Lorraine; his older siblings, who are professional and social failures; and his meek father, George, who is bullied by his supervisor, Biff Tannen.

Increasingly paranoid, Commodus instructs his advisor, Falco, to have every senator followed. \\nMaximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. He meets in secret with Lucilla and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to help Maximus escape Rome to join his legions, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. The Praetorians arrest Gracchus, and Commodus learns of the plot when Lucilla\\'s son, Lucius, innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorians attack the gladiators\\' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed.\\nTo win back public approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum.

After the Praetorians refuse to aid him, Commodus unsheathes a hidden knife; Maximus overpowers Commodus and drives the knife into his throat, killing him.

One day, Simba and his best friend Nala explore an elephant graveyard, where the two are chased by three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. Mufasa is alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though disappointed with Simba for disobeying him and putting himself and Nala in danger, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Scar, having planned the attack, visits the hyenas and convinces them to help him kill both Mufasa and Simba in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands.\\nScar sets a trap for Simba and Mufasa, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede to trample him. Mufasa saves Simba but winds up hanging perilously from the gorge\\'s edge; he begs for Scar\\'s help, but Scar throws Mufasa back into the stampede to his death. Scar tricks Simba into believing that the event was his fault and tells him to leave the kingdom and never return. He then orders the hyenas to kill Simba, who escapes.

After Rafiki advises him to learn from the past instead of running from it, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.\\nAided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who taunts Simba over his supposed role in Mufasa\\'s death and backs him to the edge of the rock. Enraged by the revelation that Scar killed his father, Simba retaliates and forces Scar to confess the truth to the rest of the pride. A battle breaks out, and Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas. Scar attempts to escape, but is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and blames his actions on the hyenas; Simba spares Scar\\'s life but, quoting what Scar told him long ago, orders Scar to leave the Pride Lands forever.

When she returns, Mathilda realizes what has happened just in time to continue down the hall to Léon\\'s apartment; he hesitantly gives her shelter.\\nMathilda quickly discovers that Léon is a hitman. She begs him to take care of her and to teach her his skills, as she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother. At first, Léon is unsettled by her presence and considers killing her in her sleep but he eventually trains Mathilda and shows her how to use various weapons. In exchange, she runs his errands, cleans his apartment and teaches him how to read. Mathilda looks up to Léon and quickly develops a crush on him, often telling him she loves him but he does not reciprocate.\\nWhen Léon is out on a job, Mathilda fills a bag with guns from Léon\\'s collection and sets out to kill Stansfield. She bluffs her way into the DEA office by posing as a delivery girl, and is ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom. One of his men arrives and informs him that Léon killed Malky, one of the corrupt DEA agents, in Chinatown that morning. Léon, after discovering her plan in a note left for him, rescues Mathilda, killing two more of Stansfield\\'s men in the process.

As a result, African-American principal and outreach worker Dr. Bob Sweeney gives Danny an ultimatum: study history directly under him through current events, which he calls \"American History X\", or be expelled. Danny\\'s first assignment is to write a paper on his older brother Derek, a past student of Sweeney\\'s and former neo-Nazi leader due to be released from prison that day.\\nYears earlier, Danny and Derek\\'s father, a firefighter, was shot and killed by a black narcotics dealer while putting out a fire at their home. Immediately after his death, Derek erupts in a racially motivated tirade in a televised interview. High-profile neo-Nazi Cameron Alexander becomes Derek\\'s mentor and they form their own violent white supremacist gang called the Disciples of Christ (D.O.C.) in Venice Beach. A skilled basketball player, Derek defeats several Crips members, winning control of the local ball courts. Later, Derek organizes an attack on an Asian-owned supermarket employing Blacks and immigrants.\\nDerek\\'s mother Doris invites Murray, her boyfriend, to dinner where an argument about Rodney King and the 1992 Los Angeles riots ensues. Derek assaults his sister Davina and openly berates Murray, causing Doris to banish Derek from the home. That night, the same group of Crips that Derek had beaten in the basketball game attempt to steal his truck. When Danny alerts Derek to the crime, Derek shoots two of the men, killing one and wounding the other, before curb stomping the wounded man to death in front of Danny. He is arrested and sentenced to three years in the California Institution for Men for voluntary manslaughter.\\nIn prison, Derek joins the Aryan Brotherhood and befriends a black inmate named Lamont. Derek becomes disillusioned by prison gang politics, disapproving of the gang\\'s dealings with non-white gangs and involvement in narcotics dealing, believing that they are only using the philosophy of white supremacy out of convenience. He loses his belief further when his friends in the D.O.C. never visit him in prison. He ultimately abandons the Aryan Brotherhood, who beat and rape him in the shower in retaliation. Derek is visited in the hospital wing by Sweeney, with whom he pleads for help to get out of prison. Sweeney rebukes Derek and reveals his own racist past, and warns that Danny has become involved with the D.O.C. to follow in Derek\\'s footsteps. After recovering and leaving the hospital wing, Derek ignores the Aryan Brotherhood while Lamont warns that he may be targeted by African-American gangs now that he is no longer under the Aryan Brotherhood\\'s protection. An attack never comes, and Derek spends the remainder of his sentence alone. When he is released, Derek thanks Lamont, whom he realizes intervened on his behalf.\\nReturning home, Derek finds Danny emulating him, sporting a D.O.C. tattoo and becoming a skinhead. Derek tries to persuade him to leave the gang, but Danny feels betrayed.

During a party at the D.O.C. compound, Derek confronts Cameron and calls him out for using him only to abandon him for three years; declaring his departure from the group and refusal to allow them to use Danny the same way, he brutally beats Cameron when the man mocks him. Seth and the others, including Derek\\'s ex-girlfriend Stacey, turn against Derek. Seth holds Derek at gunpoint, but Derek easily disarms him and holds everyone at gunpoint before fleeing with his brother.\\nAfterwards, Derek tells Danny about his experience in prison, which seems to prompt a change in Danny. The pair return home and remove racist posters from their shared bedroom. The next morning, Danny completes his paper, reflecting on his reasons for adopting neo-Nazi values from Derek, who most likely adopted such views from their father, in a flashback at dinner showing racial views, particularly against Dr. Sweeney.

Derek denies having any knowledge or involvement and reluctantly agrees to inspect the people he denounced. In the boys\\' bathroom, Danny is killed by a black student that he had confronted the day before. Derek runs to the school and, finding Danny\\'s body, mournfully cradles him while blaming himself for influencing Danny\\'s views and actions.

Twenty years later, Sullivan has been groomed as a spy inside the Massachusetts State Police (MSP) and joins the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which is building a case against Costello. Another new officer, Billy Costigan Jr., is recruited by Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam to go undercover and infiltrate Costello's crew. Costigan is selected due to his family ties to organized crime, with his deceased uncle Jackie having been connected with Costello's outfit. SIU Captain George Ellerby informs Special Investigations that the identities of undercovers will be only known to Queenan and Dignam to prevent leaks.\\nCostigan commits a series of crimes in an effort to draw the attention of Costello and his enforcer Arnold French, who later recruit Costigan into the organization due to their affection for his uncle. Over the next year, Costigan becomes increasingly involved in the operation. Due to the stress of having to maintain his cover, his emotional and mental state declines, and he threatens to quit, but Queenan and Dignam convince him to continue. Costigan's only other contact in the MSP is his police-appointed psychiatrist, Madolyn Madden, who is also Sullivan's girlfriend. Costigan and Madden later have an affair.\\nCostigan tells the MSP that Costello's crew is selling stolen computer microprocessors to China. The MSP sets up a sting, but Sullivan tips off Costello, allowing everyone to escape. The MSP and Costello realize there is a mole in their ranks and task Sullivan to find them. Meanwhile, Costigan learns that Costello is a protected FBI informant. Costigan shares his discovery with Queenan and Dignam while warning them that Costello is aware of a spy in his ranks.\\nLate one night, Costigan follows Costello into an adult theater and witnesses him giving Sullivan an envelope containing information of his crew for Sullivan to cross reference with police records. Queenan instructs Costigan to get a visual ID of Sullivan but he is unable to get a good look at his face. When Sullivan realizes that he is being followed, he mistakenly stabs a restaurant worker and flees. Later, Sullivan tries to cross-reference Costigan's picture, captured by nearby security footage, against police officer databases but cannot identify him. Queenan advises Sullivan to follow Costello to find the MSP mole. Fearing that he will soon be discovered and killed, Costigan calls Queenan and sets up a meeting to abort the operation, but Sullivan has Queenan followed, lying to the other officers that Queenan may be the spy. Sullivan also calls in Costello's gang to the meeting location.\\nWhen Costello's men arrive, Queenan helps Costigan escape before being thrown from the building's roof to his death. This causes a firefight between SIU agents and Costello's men. Angered by Queenan's murder, Dignam attacks Sullivan and is suspended by Ellerby. Timothy Delahunt, one of Costello's henchmen who was injured in the gunfight with the police, tells Costigan that he knows he is the rat, but just before he succumbs to his wounds, Delahunt implies that he is also working for law enforcement. A news report reveals that Delahunt was an undercover officer for the Boston Police Department, but Costello suspects the police department made up the claim so he would stop looking for the mole. Sullivan looks through Queenan's belongings and learns that Costello is a FBI informant after reading Queenan's notebook. Deciding to turn on him, Sullivan directs the MSP to tail Costello to a cocaine drop-off, where a gunfight erupts, killing most of Costello's crew. Sullivan confronts a wounded Costello, who admits to being an FBI informant. They exchange gunfire, and Sullivan kills him.\\nHis assignment finished, Costigan goes to Sullivan to reveal his undercover status, still unaware of the other's true identity. After Sullivan goes to another room, Costigan notices the same envelope from the theater on his desk. Costigan ascertains that Sullivan was Costello's mole, and escapes. Shortly after, Sullivan returns to find Costigan gone, and realizes that he now knows his true identity. He erases Costigan's records from police computers. Costigan visits Madolyn and hands her an envelope, instructing her to open it if something happens to him. Later, she opens a package Costigan sent to Sullivan and listens to tapes Costello made of himself with Sullivan, causing her to leave Sullivan. In order to retrieve his records, Costigan arranges to meet Sullivan on the rooftop where Queenan was killed, then arrests him. Costigan calls Trooper Brown, a friend from the police academy, to substantiate his identity, but Brown pulls a gun on Costigan when he arrives, unsure who is telling the truth.\\nCostigan says that he has evidence tying Sullivan to Costello, and Brown lets him go down the elevator. Upon reaching the lobby, Costigan and Brown are killed by Trooper Barrigan, a friend of Sullivan's who reveals himself to be another spy working for Costello. Sullivan shoots Barrigan dead, allowing him to out Barrigan as the mole while removing suspicion from himself. When Sullivan arrives home, Dignam is waiting for him inside and shoots him in the head before he leaves.

Terence Fletcher, the conductor of the Shaffer Conservatory Studio Band, recruits him to play in the Studio ensemble as an alternate for core drummer Carl Tanner. Andrew quickly discovers that Fletcher is relentlessly strict, emotionally manipulative, and abusive to his students; in one instance, he throws a chair at Andrew for failing to keep tempo during the ensemble\\'s rehearsal of Hank Levy\\'s titular piece, \"Whiplash\", then slaps and berates him when trying to teach him to keep pace.\\nDetermined to impress Fletcher, Andrew intensifies his drum practicing, oftentimes until the blisters on his hands bleed. After their first set at a jazz competition, Andrew misplaces Tanner\\'s sheet music. Since Tanner cannot play without the sheets, Andrew replaces him for the next set and does it from memory. After a successful performance of \"Whiplash\", Fletcher promotes Andrew to the core drummer. However, Andrew is taken aback when Fletcher abruptly gives the position to Ryan Connolly, a drummer from a lower-level ensemble within Shaffer. Because of his single-mindedness toward music, Andrew\\'s relationship with his family deteriorates, and he breaks up with his girlfriend, Nicole, to focus on his ambitions, citing that she will come to resent him for not making time for her. After a grueling five-hour practice session with Tanner and Connolly on \"Caravan\" in which Fletcher demands them to play at the fastest possible tempo, Andrew earns back the core position.\\nOn the way to the next competition, Andrew\\'s bus breaks down.

Though Fletcher had claimed Casey died in a car accident, he actually had hanged himself due to depression and anxiety allegedly caused by Fletcher\\'s abuse. Casey\\'s parents want Fletcher held accountable, and Andrew reluctantly agrees to testify anonymously, leading Shaffer to terminate Fletcher.\\nAndrew subsequently abandons drumming, but months later he encounters Fletcher playing piano at a jazz club. Over a drink, Fletcher admits his teaching methods were harsh but argues they were necessary to motivate his students to become successful, citing an incident in Charlie Parker\\'s rise to fame as an example. He invites Andrew to perform with his band at the JVC Jazz Festival, assuring him that the songs will be the same ones played by the Studio Band; Andrew hesitantly accepts. Andrew calls Nicole to invite her to the performance but finds out she is in a new relationship.\\nOnstage at JVC, before the first piece, Fletcher confronts Andrew and reveals he knows Andrew testified against him. As revenge, Fletcher leads the band into a song Andrew does not know and was not provided the sheet music for. After a disastrous performance, Andrew walks offstage humiliated. After being hugged backstage by his father, Andrew returns to the stage, retakes the drum kit, and cuts off Fletcher\\'s introduction to the next piece by launching into the drum intro to \"Caravan\", cueing the band himself. Initially angered, Fletcher resumes conducting. As the piece finishes, Andrew continues into an unexpected extended solo. Impressed, Fletcher nods in approval before cueing the finale.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Prestige': 'In 1890s London, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden work as shills for a magician, under the mentorship of John Cutter, an engineer who designs stage magic.

Borden begins a solo act while Cutter helps Angier launch his own career. In retaliation for his wife\\'s death, Angier sabotages Borden\\'s bullet catch trick and shoots off two of the latter\\'s fingers. Borden develops a trick he calls \"The Transported Man\", in which he appears to travel instantly between two wardrobes on opposite ends of the stage.\\nUnable to discern Borden\\'s method, Angier hires a double, Gerald Root, to perform his own version of the trick. The imitation is a greater success, but Angier is dissatisfied, as he ends the trick hidden under the stage while Root basks in the applause. Angier has his assistant Olivia spy on Borden to learn how he performs The Transported Man. However, Olivia falls in love with Borden and becomes his assistant. With her help, Borden sabotages Angier\\'s act, crippling him. Confronted by Angier, Olivia gives him a copy of Borden\\'s encoded diary.

Back at the theatre, Angier is shot by a stranger who reveals himself as Borden.\\nHow each man performed the Transported Man act is revealed: \"Alfred Borden\" was an identity shared by a pair of identical twins; offstage when one was \"Borden\", the other was disguised as \"Fallon\". When Angier had shot off one twin\\'s fingers, the other amputated his own fingers to maintain the disguise. The surviving twin loved Sarah while his brother had loved Olivia.\\nMeanwhile, when Angier used Tesla\\'s machine, every performance created a new Angier, while the original drowned in a tank beneath the stage.

He is confronted by a mysterious figure he calls \"Keyser,\" who shoots him dead and sets fire to the ship. The next day, the police recover 27 bodies and only two survivors: Arkosh Kovash (\"Ákos Kovács\"), a Hungarian mobster hospitalized with severe burns, and Roger \"Verbal\" Kint, a physically disabled con artist. U.S. Customs agent Dave Kujan flies to Los Angeles from New York City to interrogate Verbal. The men are left alone in a borrowed office belonging to LAPD police sergeant Jeff Rabin while FBI agent Jack Baer visits a hospitalized Kovash. The events that led Keaton, Verbal, and their associates onto the ship are then described by Verbal via flashback.\\nSix weeks earlier in New York City, Keaton and Verbal are arrested alongside fellow criminals Michael McManus, Fred Fenster, and Todd Hockney and placed in a police lineup as suspects in a truck hijacking that none of them admits to participating in. Believing the police were unfairly harassing them, McManus proposes they pull a heist to get revenge on the NYPD. Trying to go straight, Keaton initially refuses but eventually agrees to help rob a jewel smuggler being escorted by corrupt cops, netting millions in emeralds and getting over fifty cops arrested after leaking their activities to the press. They then go to California to fence the jewels through a man named Redfoot, who connects them with another jewel heist, but it goes badly and the contents are instead revealed to be China White (synthetic heroin). The men learn that the job was arranged by a lawyer named Kobayashi, who says he arranged for their arrests in New York and that his employer, mysterious Turkish crime lord Keyser Söze, from whom each of the men has unwittingly stolen, has ordered them to raid a ship holding Argentinian drug dealers and destroy $91 million worth of cocaine being sold on board. The cash brought for the exchange will be their reward.\\nDuring Kujan\\'s interrogation, he learns that there was no cocaine on the ship, and Söze was seen onboard. At the hospital, Baer learns that Kovács has seen Söze and has a sketch artist begin making a picture.  Verbal then tells Kujan a legend about Söze: he was a small-time drug runner who murdered his own family when they were being held hostage by Hungarian mobsters, then massacred the mobsters and their families before disappearing, and from then on conducted business only indirectly through underlings who are mostly unfamiliar with their true employer. Söze thus became a fearsome urban legend, \"a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night.\"\\nConcluding his story, Verbal reveals that Fenster was killed after trying to flee; the men then threatened Kobayashi, only to accept the assignment when he threatened their loved ones. The men attacked the ship during the night, killing several Argentinian and Hungarian gangsters before discovering that there was no cocaine. An unseen assailant killed Hockney, McManus, Keaton, and a prisoner in one of the ship\\'s cabins. The mysterious figure then set fire to the ship as Verbal looked on from a hiding place on the dock.\\nKujan deduces that Keaton must be Söze, as the prisoner killed on the ship was Arturo Marquez, a smuggler who escaped prosecution by claiming that he could identify Söze. Marquez was represented by lawyer Edie Finneran, Keaton\\'s girlfriend, who was recently murdered. Kujan claims that the Argentinians took Marquez to sell him to Söze\\'s Hungarian rivals. Keaton then used the assault so that he could kill Marquez personally and fake his own death. Verbal finally confesses that Keaton had been behind everything, but refuses to testify in court. Verbal\\'s bail is posted, and he is released.\\nMoments later, Kujan realizes Verbal seemingly fabricated his entire story, improvising on the spot by piecing together details from random items in Rabin\\'s cluttered office. Verbal walks outside, gradually losing his limp and flexing his supposedly disabled hand. As Kujan pursues Verbal, a fax arrives at the police station with the artist\\'s facial composite of Söze. The picture resembles Verbal, revealing that he was Söze the entire time. Söze enters a car driven by \"Kobayashi\" and leaves, moments before Kujan arrives on the scene. A voiceover from Söze is then heard from when he spoke to Kujan earlier, saying \"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn\\'t exist, and like that...he\\'s gone.\".\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Grave of the Fireflies': \"In Kobe, the spirits of young war orphans Seita and Setsuko Yokokawa reunite and board a ghostly train as they recount how they survived the Bombing of Kobe in World War II.\\nIn June 1945, American Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers destroy most of Kobe.

As they run out of rice, Seita steals from farmers and loots homes during air raids, for which he is beaten and sent to the police by a farmer. The officer realizes Seita is stealing due to hunger and releases him. When Setsuko falls ill, a doctor explains that she is suffering from malnutrition.

Before he can meet his contact, Ugarte is arrested by the local police under Captain Louis Renault, the unabashedly corrupt prefect of police. Ugarte dies in custody without revealing that Rick has the letters.\\nThen the reason for Rick\\'s cynical nature—former lover Ilsa Lund—enters his establishment. Spotting Rick\\'s friend and house pianist, Sam, Ilsa asks him to play \"As Time Goes By\". Rick storms over, furious that Sam disobeyed his order never to perform that song again, and is stunned to see Ilsa. She is accompanied by her husband, Victor Laszlo, a renowned fugitive Czechoslovak Resistance leader. A flashback reveals Ilsa left Rick without explanation when the couple were planning to flee as the German army neared Paris, embittering Rick. Laszlo and Ilsa need the letters to escape, while German Major Strasser arrives in Casablanca to prevent just that.\\nWhen Laszlo makes inquiries, Signor Ferrari, an underworld figure and Rick\\'s friendly business rival, divulges his suspicion that Rick has the letters. Laszlo returns to Rick\\'s cafe that night and tries to buy them. Rick refuses to sell, telling Laszlo to ask his wife why. They are interrupted when Strasser leads a group of German officers in singing \"Die Wacht am Rhein\". Laszlo orders the house band to play \"La Marseillaise\". When the bandleader looks to Rick, the latter nods, and Laszlo begins to sing. Patriotic fervor grips the crowd, and everyone joins in, drowning out the Germans. Afterwards, Strasser has Renault close the club on a flimsy pretext.\\n\\nLater, Ilsa confronts Rick in the deserted café; when he refuses to give her the letters, she threatens him with a gun but then confesses that she still loves him. She explains that when they met and fell in love in Paris in 1940, she believed her husband had been killed attempting to escape from a concentration camp. Then she learned that Laszlo was alive and hiding near Paris. She left Rick without explanation to nurse her sick husband. Rick\\'s bitterness dissolves. He agrees to help, letting her believe she will stay with him when Laszlo leaves. When Laszlo unexpectedly shows up, having narrowly escaped a police raid on a Resistance meeting, Rick has waiter Carl spirit Ilsa away. Laszlo, aware of Rick\\'s love for Ilsa, tries to persuade him to use the letters to take her to safety.\\nWhen the police arrest Laszlo on a trumped-up charge, Rick persuades Renault to release him by promising to set him up for a much more serious crime: possession of the letters. To allay Renault\\'s suspicions, Rick explains that he and Ilsa will use the letters to leave for America. When Renault tries to arrest Laszlo as arranged, however, Rick forces him at gunpoint to assist in their escape. At the last moment, Rick makes Ilsa board the plane to Lisbon with Laszlo, telling her that she would regret it if she stayed, \"Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.\" Strasser, tipped off by Renault, drives up alone. When Strasser attempts to stop the plane, Rick shoots him dead. Policemen arrive. Renault pauses, then orders them to \"round up the usual suspects.\" He suggests to Rick that they join the Free French in Brazzaville. As they walk away into the fog, Rick says, \"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\"\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Harakiri': 'The film takes place in Edo in the year 1630. A rōnin called Tsugumo Hanshirō arrives at the estate of the Iyi Clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him, Saitō Kageyu, the daimyō\\'s senior counselor, tells Hanshirō the story of another rōnin, Chijiiwa Motome—formerly of the same clan as Hanshirō.\\nSaitō scornfully recalls the practice of rōnin requesting the chance to commit seppuku on the clan\\'s land, but in fact  hoping to be turned away and given alms. Motome had arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as Hanshirō. Infuriated by the rising number of \"suicide bluffs\", the three most senior samurai of the clan—Yazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuro—persuaded Saitō to force Motome to follow through and kill himself, ignoring his request for a couple of days delay. Upon examining Motome\\'s swords, his blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \"pawn his soul\", the House of Iyi forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating.\\nDespite this warning, Hanshirō insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he is sincere in wanting to commit seppuku. Just as the ceremony is about to begin, Hanshirō is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of Saitō and the Iyi retainers, Hanshirō successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro — the three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, with each claiming to be too ill to attend.\\nWhile waiting for the messengers to return, Hanshirō recounts his life story to the assembled samurai, starting with the admission that he did know Motome. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shōgun. His lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, Hanshirō planned to die alongside him. To prevent this, Hanshirō\\'s closest friend took his place instead, leaving Hanshirō responsible for his teenage son, Motome. In order to support Motome and his own daughter Miho, Hanshirō rented a hovel in the slums of Edo, taking up work as a fan and umbrella craftsman while Motome became a teacher. Realizing the love between Motome and Miho, Hanshirō arranged for them to marry. Soon after, they had a son, Kingo.\\nWhen Miho became ill with tuberculosis, Motome could not bear the thought of losing her and did everything to raise money to hire a doctor. When Kingo also fell ill, Motome left one morning, saying he planned to take out a loan from a moneylender. Later that evening, Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro brought home Motome\\'s mutilated body, and described and mocked his death before leaving. It is now clear that Motome had requested a delay so he could visit his family and put his affairs in order. A few days later, Kingo died, and Miho lost the will to live and died, leaving Hanshirō with nothing. Finishing his story, Hanshirō explains that his sole desire is to join Motome, Miho, and Kingo in death. He explains, however, that they have every right to ask him whether justice has been exacted for their deaths. Therefore, Hanshirō asks Saitō if he has any statement of regret to convey to Motome, Miho, and Kingo. He explains that, if Saitō does so, he will die without saying another word. Saitō refuses, calling Motome an \"extortionist\" who deserved to die.\\nAfter provoking Saitō\\'s laughter by calling the samurai moral code bushido a facade, Hanshirō reveals the last part of his story. Before coming to the Iyi estate, he tracked down Hayato and Umenosuke and cut off their topknots. Hikokuro then visited Hanshirō\\'s hovel and, with great respect, challenged him to a duel. After a brief but tense sword fight, Hikokuro suffers a double disgrace: his sword is broken and his topknot is taken as well. As proof, Hanshirō removes their labelled topknots from his kimono and casts them upon the palace courtyard. He mocks the Iyi clan, saying that if the men he humiliated were true samurai, they would not be hiding out of shame. He also questions the clan\\'s honor and bushido itself, pointing out that they should not have ignored Motome’s request for a delay to his seppuku without investigating the reason why he asked, but they were too preoccupied with their supposed honor to care.\\nHaving badly lost face, an enraged Saitō calls Hanshirō a madman and orders the retainers to kill him. In a fierce battle, Hanshirō kills four samurai, wounds eight, and contemptuously smashes into pieces the antique suit of armor which symbolizes the glorious history of the House of Iyi. Finally, the clan corners Hanshirō and prepares to kill him not with swords, but with three matchlock guns. As Hanshirō commits seppuku, he is simultaneously shot by all three gunmen.\\nTerrified that the Iyi clan will be abolished if word gets out that \"a half starved rōnin\" killed so many of their retainers, Saitō announces that all deaths caused by Hanshirō shall be explained by \"illness\". At the same time, a messenger returns reporting that Hikokuro had killed himself the day before, while Hayato and Umenosuke are both faking illness. Saitō angrily orders that Hayato and Umenosuke are to be forced to commit seppuku as atonement for losing their topknots. Those three deaths shall be also attributed to “illness”.\\nAs the suit of armor is cleaned and re-erected, a new entry in the official records of the House of Iyi is read by a voiceover. Hanshirō is declared to have been mentally unstable, and he and Motome are both listed as having died through harakiri. The Shōgun is said to have issued a personal commendation to the lord of the Iyi clan for how his councilors handled the suicide bluffs of Motome and Hanshirō. At the end of his letter, the Shōgun praises the House of Iyi and their samurai as exemplars of bushido. As workers scrub the blood from the ground of the clan\\'s estate, one of them finds a severed topknot and places it in his work bucket.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Intouchables': 'At night in Paris, Driss is driving Philippe\\'s Maserati Quattroporte at high speed. Chased through the streets by the police, they are eventually cornered. Driss claims the quadriplegic Philippe must get to the emergency room urgently; Philippe pretends to have a seizure and the fooled police officers escort them. After arriving at the hospital, Driss drives away.\\nThe story of friendship between the two men is then told as a flashback: Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic owner of a luxurious hôtel particulier, and his assistant Magalie are interviewing potential live-in caregivers. Driss has no ambitions to get hired; he is only waiting to get a signature on a document proving his interview was rejected, in order to continue receiving his benefits. He is told to come back the next morning to collect his signed document.\\nThe next day when Driss returns, Philippe\\'s aide Yvonne greets him, telling him he has the job on a trial basis. Despite being uninterested and inexperienced, he does well caring for Philippe, albeit using unconventional methods. Driss learns the extent of his employer\\'s disability, aiding Philippe in every aspect of his life. A friend of Philippe\\'s reveals that Driss was imprisoned for six months for robbery, but Philippe does not care about Driss\\'s past. As Driss is the only one who does not treat Philippe with pity, he will not fire Driss as long as he does his job properly.\\nPhilippe explains his disability resulted from a paragliding incident and that his wife died without bearing children. Gradually, Driss helps him to organise his private life, including disciplining his precocious adopted daughter Elisa. Driss discovers modern art, opera and starts painting. For Philippe\\'s birthday, a private classical music concert is performed in his living room. Philippe educates Driss on famous classical pieces, but Driss only recognizes them as advert music or cartoon themes. Feeling the concert is too boring, Driss plays Earth, Wind & Fire\\'s \"Boogie Wonderland\", livening up the party, with the guests also enjoying the music.\\nDiscovering Philippe has a purely epistolary relationship with a woman called Eléonore who lives in Dunkirk, Driss encourages his employer to meet her, but Philippe fears her reaction when she discovers his disability. Driss persuades him to talk to her by phone. Philippe agrees to send a photo of himself in a wheelchair to her, but he hesitates and asks his aide, Yvonne, to send a picture as he was before his accident. A date between them is agreed to, but at the last minute Philippe is too scared to meet Eléonore and leaves with Yvonne before she arrives. Philippe then calls Driss, inviting him to fly with him in his Dassault Falcon 900 private jet for a paragliding weekend in the Alps.\\nDriss\\'s cousin, Adam, in trouble with a gang, comes to fetch Driss at the mansion on the pretext of delivering mail. Overhearing, Philippe recognizes Driss\\'s need to be supportive to his family and releases him from his job, suggesting he may not want to push a wheelchair all his life.\\nDriss returns home, joins his friends and manages to help his cousin. In the meantime new caregivers have replaced Driss but Philippe is not happy with any of them. His morale is very low and he stops taking care of himself. He grows a beard and looks ill. Worried, Yvonne calls Driss back.\\nUpon arrival Driss drives Philippe in the Maserati, which brings the story back to the initial police chase. After they elude the police, Driss takes Philippe to the seaside. Once Philippe has shaved and dressed, they arrive at a Cabourg restaurant on the sea front. Driss suddenly leaves the table, saying good luck to Philippe on his lunch date. A few seconds later Eléonore arrives. Emotionally touched, Philippe looks through the window and sees Driss outside, smiling at him. Driss bids Philippe farewell and walks away as Phillipe and Eléonore chat and enjoy each other\\'s company.\\nThe film ends with shots of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and Abdel Sellou, the people on whom the story is based, together on a hillside, reminiscent of the paragliding scene earlier in the film.

Salvatore shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in thirty years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo was, Salvatore is not able to fall asleep and flashes back to his childhood.\\nA few years after World War II, eight-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the local movie house, Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the middle-aged projectionist, Alfredo, who often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing because there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing scenes with romantic kisses or embraces. The local priest, owner of the cinema, had ordered these sections to be censored, and the deleted scenes are cut from the film reels by Alfredo and piled on the projection room floor, where Alfredo keeps them until he can splice them back in for the film to be sent to the next town.\\nAlfredo eventually teaches Salvatore how to operate the film projector. One day, Cinema Paradiso catches fire as Alfredo is projecting The Firemen of Viggiù after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo\\'s life, but not before a reel of nitrate film explodes in Alfredo\\'s face, leaving him permanently blind. The movie house is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio Spaccafico, using his winnings from a football lottery. Salvatore, still a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as only he knows how to run the machines.\\nAbout a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the \"Nuovo Cinema Paradiso\". His relationship with the blind Alfredo has strengthened, and Salvatore often looks to him for help – advice that Alfredo often dispenses by quoting classic films. Salvatore has been experimenting with filming, using a home movie camera; doing this he has met, and captured on film, a girl named Elena Mendola, daughter of a wealthy banker, and has fallen in love with her. Salvatore woos – and wins – Elena\\'s heart, only to lose her due to her father\\'s disapproval.\\nAs Elena and her family move away, Salvatore leaves town for compulsory military service (even though, as a war orphan, he should be exempted from it). His attempts to write to Elena are fruitless; his letters are returned as undeliverable. Upon his return from the military, Alfredo urges Salvatore to leave Giancaldo permanently, counseling that the town is too small for Salvatore to ever find his dreams. Moreover, the old man tells him, once Salvatore leaves, he must pursue his destiny wholeheartedly, never looking back and never returning, even to visit; he must never give in to nostalgia or even write or think about them. They tearfully embrace, and Salvatore leaves to pursue his future as a filmmaker.\\nBack in the present, Salvatore realizes that he is very satisfied with his life from a professional point of view but not from a personal one, so decides to return home to attend Alfredo\\'s funeral. Though the town has changed greatly, he now understands why Alfredo thought it was important that he leave. Alfredo\\'s widow tells him that the old man followed Salvatore\\'s successes with pride and he left him something: an unlabeled film reel and the old stool that Salvatore once stood on to operate the projector. Salvatore learns that Cinema Paradiso is to be demolished to make way for a parking lot. At the funeral, he recognizes the faces of many people who attended the cinema when he was the projectionist.\\nSalvatore returns to Rome, watches Alfredo\\'s reel and discovers it comprises all the romantic scenes that the priest had ordered Alfredo to cut from the movies; Alfredo had spliced the sequences together to form a single unreduced film of aching desire and lustful frenzy (it was never explained how the projectionist successfully managed to forward the bowdlerized film copies with sections missing).\\nThe final scenes shows Salvatore coming to peace with his past, with tears in his eyes.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Once Upon a Time in the West': 'A train arrives at the Old West town of \"Flagstone\".

Meanwhile, Frank and his henchmen kill McBain and his three children at their \"Sweetwater\" ranch and leave behind evidence to frame Cheyenne for the murders.\\nA woman named Jill arrives in Flagstone, supposedly to marry McBain at Sweetwater. In fact, she is a former New Orleans prostitute who married McBain a month earlier, so she is the sole heir to Sweetwater. As it will emerge, McBain knew the railroad would pass through Sweetwater one day and planned to build a watering station there, subject to a reverter that he would forfeit Sweetwater if the station was not built by the time the railroad reached it. Morton told Frank to only intimidate McBain, and the murder has put them at odds. Morton wants to make a deal with Jill, but Frank wants the land for himself.\\nCheyenne denies that it was his men who tried to ambush Harmonica and murder the McBains.

Except for Cheyenne, who heads to Sweetwater, everyone is killed, including Morton. When Frank sees the aftermath of the fight, he rides to Sweetwater too, where he finds Harmonica waiting. Cheyenne has arrived earlier, but he remains in the ranch house with Jill. Outside, Harmonica and Frank engage in a showdown; through a flashback, it is revealed that Frank had once hanged Harmonica\\'s older brother, forcing the younger brother to support him on his shoulders. Just before the panting boy collapsed under the weight, Frank had forced a harmonica into his mouth, telling him to \"keep your lovin\\' brother happy\". \\nHarmonica beats Frank to the draw. As he lies dying, Frank again asks Harmonica\\'s identity and Harmonica places the instrument in Frank\\'s mouth. Frank remembers, nods his head, and dies.   \\nJill hopes he will stay with her but, as Cheyenne has already told her, that won\\'t happen. Jill asks Harmonica to come back and he says: \"Some day\".

Per company policy requiring any potential distress signal be investigated, they land on the moon despite Parker's protests, sustaining damage from its atmosphere and rocky landscape. The engineers stay on board for repairs while Dallas, Kane, and Lambert investigate the terrain. They discover the signal originates from a derelict alien ship and enter it, losing contact with the Nostromo. Ripley deciphers part of the transmission, determining it as a warning, but cannot relay the information to those on the derelict ship.\\nMeanwhile, Kane discovers a chamber containing hundreds of large, egg-like objects. When he touches one, a creature springs out, penetrates his helmet, and attaches itself to his face. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo. As the acting senior officer, Ripley refuses to let them aboard, citing quarantine regulations, but Ash overrides her decision and lets them inside. Ash attempts to remove the creature from Kane's face, but stops when he discovers that its extremely corrosive acidic blood could hurt Kane and potentially damage the hull. It later freely detaches and is found dead. The ship is partially repaired, and the crew continues their journey back to Earth. Kane awakens with some memory loss but seems to be otherwise unharmed.

Brett follows the crew's cat, Jones, into a landing leg compartment, where the now-fully-grown alien attacks Brett and disappears with his body.

With no further options, she flees to the shuttle, carrying Jones, and narrowly escapes as the Nostromo explodes.\\nAs Ripley prepares for stasis, she discovers that the alien is aboard, having wedged itself into a narrow space. She dons a spacesuit and uses gas to flush the creature out. It approaches Ripley, but before it can attack, she opens an airlock door, almost blasting it into space. However, it hangs on by gripping the frame. Ripley shoots it with a grappling hook, but the gun catches as the airlock door closes, tethering the alien to the shuttle.

But the next morning history repeats itself: the millionaire is again sober and the Tramp is again out on his ear.\\nFinding that the girl is not at her usual street-corner, the Tramp goes to her apartment, where he overhears a doctor tell the grandmother that the girl is very ill: \"She has a fever and needs careful attention.\" Determined to help, the Tramp takes a job as a street sweeper.\\nOn his lunch break, he brings the girl groceries while her grandmother is out selling flowers. To entertain her he reads a newspaper aloud; in it is a story about a Viennese doctor\\'s blindness cure. \"Wonderful, then I\\'ll be able to see you\", says the girl – and the Tramp is struck by what may happen should she gain her sight and discover that he is not the wealthy man she imagines. He also finds an eviction notice the girl\\'s grandmother has hidden. As he leaves, he promises the girl that he will pay the rent.\\nThe Tramp returns to work to find himself fired – he has been late once too often. A boxer convinces him to fight in a fake bout; they will \"go easy\" on each other and split the prize money. But the boxer flees on learning he is about to be arrested and is replaced by a no-nonsense fighter who knocks the Tramp out despite the Tramp\\'s creative and nimble efforts to keep out of reach.\\nThe Tramp encounters the drunken millionaire a third time and is again invited to the mansion. The Tramp relates the girl\\'s plight and the millionaire gives him money for her operation. Burglars knock the millionaire out and take the rest of his money. The police find the Tramp with the money given to him by the millionaire, who because of the knock on the head does not remember giving it. The Tramp evades the police long enough to get the money to the girl, telling her he will be going away for a time; in due course he is apprehended and imprisoned.\\nMonths later the Tramp is released. He goes to the girl\\'s customary street corner but she is not there. We learn that the girl – her sight restored – now runs a busy flower shop with her grandmother. But she has not forgotten her mysterious benefactor, whom she imagines to be rich and handsome: when an elegant young man enters the shop she wonders for a moment whether \"he\" has returned.\\nThe Tramp happens by the shop, where the girl is arranging flowers in the window. He stoops to retrieve a flower discarded in the gutter. After a brief skirmish with his old nemeses, the newsboys, he turns to the shop\\'s window through which he suddenly sees the girl, who has been watching him without (of course) knowing who he is. At the sight of her he is frozen for a few seconds, then breaks into a broad smile. The girl is flattered and giggles to her employee, \"I\\'ve made a conquest!\" Via pantomime through the glass she offers him a fresh flower (to replace the crushed one he took from the gutter) and a coin.\\nSuddenly embarrassed, the Tramp begins to shuffle away, but the girl steps to the shop door and again offers the flower, which he shyly accepts. She takes his hand and presses the coin into it, then abruptly stops and her smile turns to a look of puzzlement as she recognizes the touch of his hand. She runs her fingers along his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then gasps, \"You?\" The Tramp nods and asks, \"You can see now?\" The girl replies, \"Yes, I can see now\", and presses his hand to her heart with a tearful smile. Relieved and elated, the Tramp smiles back.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Apocalypse Now': 'In 1969, during the Vietnam War, U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz is waging a brutal guerrilla war against NVA, Viet Cong and Khmer Rouge forces without permission from his commanders, based at a remote jungle outpost in eastern Cambodia, where he commands American,  Montagnard and local Khmer militia troops, who see him as a demigod.\\nBurnt-out MACV-SOG operative Captain Benjamin L. Willard is summoned to I Field Force headquarters in Nha Trang. He is ordered to \"terminate Kurtz\\'s command ... with extreme prejudice\".\\nAmbivalent, Willard joins a U.S. Navy river patrol boat (PBR) commanded by Chief Petty Officer Phillips, with crewmen Lance, \"Chef\" and \"Mr. Clean\" to quietly navigate up the Nùng River to Kurtz\\'s outpost. Before reaching the coastal mouth of the Nùng, they rendezvous with the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment—a helicopter-borne air assault unit of the elite 1st Cavalry Division, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore—to discuss safe passage. Kilgore is initially uncooperative, as he has not received word about their mission through normal channels, but he becomes more engaged after discovering that Lance is a well-known surfer. The commander is an avid surfer himself and agrees to escort them through the Nùng\\'s Viet Cong-held coastal mouth. The helicopter squadron, playing \"Ride of the Valkyries\" on loudspeakers, raids at dawn with a napalm strike. Before Kilgore can lure Lance out to surf on the newly conquered beach, Willard gathers the sailors to the PBR to continue their mission.\\nTension arises as Willard believes himself in command of the PBR, while the Chief prioritizes routine patrol objectives over Willard\\'s. Slowly making their way upriver, Willard partially reveals his mission to the Chief to assuage his concerns about why his mission should proceed. As Willard studies Kurtz\\'s dossier, he is struck by the mid-career sacrifice Kurtz made by leaving a prestigious Pentagon assignment to join Special Forces, with no prospect of advancing beyond the rank of colonel.\\nAt a remote U.S. Army outpost, Willard and Lance seek information on what is upriver and receive a dispatch bag containing official and personal mail. Unable to find any commanding officer, Willard orders the Chief to continue. Willard learns via the dispatch that another MACV-SOG operative, Special Forces Captain Richard Colby, was sent on an earlier mission identical to Willard\\'s and has since joined Kurtz.Lance activates a smoke grenade while under the influence of LSD, attracting enemy fire, causing Mr. Clean\\'s death. Further upriver, Chief is impaled by a spear thrown by Montagnards and attempts to kill Willard by forcing the spear point at him protruding from his own chest before Willard subdues him. Willard reveals his mission to Chef, who is now in charge of the PBR.\\nThe PBR arrives at Kurtz\\'s outpost, an abandoned Khmer temple teeming with Montagnards and strewn with remains of victims. Willard, Chef and Lance are greeted by an American photojournalist, who praises Kurtz\\'s genius. They encounter a near-catatonic Colby. Willard sets out with Lance to find Kurtz, leaving Chef with orders to call in an airstrike on the outpost if the two do not return.\\nIn the camp, Willard is bound and brought before Kurtz, after which he is locked in a bamboo cage. Kurtz comes to place Chef\\'s severed head onto Willard\\'s lap, preventing the airstrike. Willard is released and Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, praising the ruthlessness of the Viet Cong. Kurtz discusses his family and asks that Willard tell his son about him after his death.\\nThat night, as the Montagnards ceremonially kill a water buffalo, Willard kills Kurtz with a machete. All in the compound see Willard departing, carrying a collection of Kurtz\\'s writings, and bow down to him. Willard gathers Lance, boards the PBR, and heads back down river, away from the beaten Montagnards.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Memento': 'The film starts with a Polaroid photograph of a dead man. As the sequence plays backward, the photo reverts to its undeveloped state, entering the camera before the man is shot in the head. The film then continues, alternating between black-and-white and color sequences.\\nThe black-and-white sequences begin with Leonard Shelby, a former insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen and unknown caller. Leonard has anterograde amnesia and is unable to store recent memories, the result of an attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife Catherine, but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker\\'s name is \"John G\" or \"James G\". Leonard investigates using notes, Polaroid photos, and tattoos to keep track of the information he discovers. Leonard recalls Sammy Jankis, another anterograde amnesiac, from his insurance industry days. After tests confirmed Sammy\\'s inability to learn tasks through repetition, Leonard believed that his condition was at best psychological (and perhaps faked) and turned down his insurance claim. Sammy\\'s distraught wife repeatedly asked Sammy to administer her insulin shots for her diabetes, hoping he would remember having recently given her a shot and avoid giving her a fatal overdose. However, Sammy administered each injection, and his wife died.\\nThe color sequences are shown reverse-chronologically. In the story\\'s chronology, Leonard self-directively gets a tattoo of John G\\'s license plate. Finding a note in his clothes, he meets Natalie, a bartender who resents Leonard because he wears the clothes and drives the car of her boyfriend, Jimmy Grantz. After understanding Leonard\\'s condition, she uses it to get Leonard to drive a man named Dodd out of town and offers to run the license plate as a favor through the Department of Motor Vehicle\\'s database. Meanwhile, Leonard meets with a contact, Teddy, who helps with Dodd, but warns about Natalie. Leonard finds that he had previously annotated his Polaroid of Teddy, warning himself not to trust Teddy. Natalie provides Leonard with the driver\\'s license for a John Edward Gammell, Teddy\\'s full name. Confirming Leonard\\'s information on \"John G\" and his warnings, Leonard drives Teddy to an abandoned building, leading to the opening where he shoots him.\\nIn the final black-and-white sequence, prompted by the caller, Leonard meets with Teddy, an undercover officer, who has found Leonard\\'s \"John G\", Jimmy, and directs Leonard to the abandoned building. When Jimmy arrives, Leonard strangles him fatally and takes a Polaroid photo of the body. As the photo develops, the black-and-white transitions to the final color sequence. Leonard swaps clothes with Jimmy, hearing him whisper \"Sammy\". As Leonard has only told Sammy\\'s story to those he has met, he suddenly doubts Jimmy\\'s role in his wife\\'s murder. Teddy arrives and asserts that Jimmy was John G, but when Leonard is undeterred, Teddy says that he helped him kill the real attacker a year ago, and Teddy has been using Leonard ever since. Teddy points out that since the name \"John G\" is common, Leonard will cyclically forget and begin his search again and that even Teddy himself has a \"John G\" name. Further, Teddy says that Sammy\\'s story is Leonard\\'s own story, a memory Leonard has repressed to escape feelings of guilt.\\nAfter hearing Teddy confess all of this, Leonard burns the photograph of the dead Jimmy and the photo of himself right after killing the real attacker a year ago, pointing to his chest where he would get a tattoo to document his successful revenge. In a monologue, Leonard explains that he is willing to lie to himself in order to get justice against anyone who has wronged him. He, therefore, targets Teddy by ordering a tattoo of Teddy\\'s license plate number and writing a note to himself that Teddy is not to be trusted so that he will mistake Teddy for John G and kill him. Leonard drives off in Jimmy\\'s car, confident that, despite this lie, he will retain enough awareness of the world to know that his actions have consequences.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark': 'In 1936, American archaeologist Indiana Jones recovers a Golden Idol from a booby-trapped Peruvian temple. Rival archaeologist René Belloq corners him and steals the idol; Jones escapes in a waiting float plane. After returning to the United States, Jones is briefed by two Army Intelligence agents that Nazi German forces are excavating at Tanis, Egypt, and one of their telegrams mentions Jones\\' former mentor Abner Ravenwood. Jones deduces that the Nazis are seeking the Ark of the Covenant, which Adolf Hitler believes will make their army invincible. The agents recruit Jones to recover the Ark first.\\nAt a bar in Nepal, Jones reunites with Ravenwood\\'s daughter Marion, with whom Jones once had an illicit relationship, and learns that Ravenwood is dead. The bar is set ablaze during a scuffle with Gestapo agent Arnold Toht, who arrives to take a medallion from Marion. Toht attempts to recover the medallion from the flames, but only burns its image into his hand. Jones and Marion take the medallion and escape.\\nTraveling to Cairo, the pair meet Jones\\'s friend Sallah. Sallah reveals Belloq is assisting the Nazis, who have fashioned an incomplete replica medallion from the burns on Toht\\'s hand. Nazi soldiers and mercenaries attack Jones, and Marion is seemingly killed, leaving Jones despondent. An imam deciphers the medallion for Jones, revealing that one side bears a warning against disturbing the Ark, and the other bears the complete measurements for the \"staff of Ra\", an item used to locate the Ark. Jones and Sallah realize that the Nazis are digging in the wrong location, infiltrate the Nazi dig site, and use the medallion and the correctly sized staff of Ra to locate the Well of Souls, the Ark\\'s resting place. They recover the Ark, a golden, intricately decorated chest, but Belloq and the Nazis discover them and seize it. Jones and Marion, whom Belloq has held captive, are sealed inside the well, but the pair escape and Jones captures a truck carrying the Ark. Alongside Marion, Jones arranges to transport the Ark to London aboard a tramp steamer. A German U-boat intercepts the steamer and seizes the Ark and Marion; Jones covertly boards the U-boat. The vessel travels to an island in the Aegean Sea, where Belloq intends to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler.\\nOn the island, Jones ambushes the Nazi group and threatens to destroy the Ark, but surrenders after Belloq deduces that Jones would never destroy something so historically significant, also surmising that Jones wants to know if the Ark\\'s power is real. The Nazis restrain Jones and Marion at the testing site as Belloq ceremonially opens the Ark but finds only sand inside. At Jones\\' instruction, he and Marion close their eyes to avoid looking at the opened Ark, as it releases spirits, flames, and bolts of energy that kill Belloq, Toht, and the assembled Nazis before sealing itself shut. Jones and Marion open their eyes to find the area cleared of bodies and their bindings removed.\\nBack in Washington, D.C., the United States government rewards Jones for securing the Ark. Despite Jones\\' insistence, the agents state only that the Ark has been moved to an undisclosed location for \"top men\" to study. In a vast warehouse, the Ark is crated up and stored among countless other crates.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Lives of Others': 'In 1984 East Germany, Stasi Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, code name HGW XX/7, is ordered by his friend and superior, Lt. Col. Anton Grubitz, to spy on playwright Georg Dreyman, whose pro-communist politics and international recognition have so far kept the state from directly monitoring him. Dreyman\\'s very appearance as a model East German mystifies Grubitz; the playwright has no known vices or record of disloyalty or dissent at all. Wiesler and his team bug Dreyman\\'s apartment, set up surveillance equipment, and report Dreyman\\'s activities. Wiesler subsequently learns that Dreyman\\'s surveillance is at the request of Minister of Culture Bruno Hempf, who covets Dreyman\\'s girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland. After an intervention by Wiesler leads to Dreyman\\'s discovering Sieland\\'s relationship with Hempf, he implores her not to meet him again and to be true to herself. She reconciles with Dreyman.\\nDreyman\\'s friend Albert Jerska, a blacklisted theatrical director, gives him sheet music for Sonate vom Guten Menschen (Sonata for a Good Man). Shortly afterwards, Jerska hangs himself. Dreyman publishes an anonymous article in prominent West German newsweekly  Der Spiegel accusing the state of concealing the country\\'s elevated suicide rates. When Dreyman and his friends feign a defection attempt to determine whether or not his flat is bugged, a sympathetic Wiesler does not report it and the conspirators believe they are safe. Since all East German typewriters are registered and identifiable, a Der Spiegel editor smuggles Dreyman a Groma Büromaschinen Kolibri, an ultra-flat typewriter with a red ribbon, which he hides under a floorboard.\\nDreyman\\'s article angers the East German authorities but the Stasi cannot link it to a registered typewriter. Rejected by Sieland, Hempf orders Grubitz to arrest her. She is blackmailed into revealing Dreyman\\'s authorship of the article, although the Stasi do not find the typewriter. Grubitz, suspicious of Wiesler, has him do the follow-up interrogation of Sieland. Wiesler makes Sieland reveal the typewriter\\'s location.\\nWhen the Stasi return to Dreyman\\'s apartment, Sieland realises that Dreyman will know she betrayed him and flees into the street and is hit by a truck. Dreyman runs after her and Sieland dies in his arms. Grubitz finds nothing beneath the floorboard, Wiesler having removed the typewriter before the search team arrived; he ends the investigation with a perfunctory apology to Dreyman. Grubitz then informs Wiesler that while the investigation is over, so is Wiesler\\'s career; his remaining years with the Stasi will be in Department M, a dead-end assignment for disgraced agents. The same day, Mikhail Gorbachev is elected leader of the Soviet Union.\\nOn 9 November 1989, Wiesler is steam-opening letters when news of the fall of the Berlin Wall comes on the radio. He silently gets up and leaves the office, followed by his co-workers.\\nTwo years later, Hempf and Dreyman meet at a performance of Dreyman\\'s play, each reflecting on life before and after German reunification. Dreyman asks why he was never monitored by the Stasi, to which Hempf replies that he had been: \"We knew everything.\" Dreyman finds the abandoned listening devices in his apartment and rips them from the walls.\\nDreyman reviews his Stasi files at the Stasi Records Agency, reading that Sieland was released just before the second search and could not have removed the typewriter. He is confused by other contradictions until, seeing a fingerprint in red ink, or maybe Sieland\\'s blood, in the final report, he realises that the officer in charge of his surveillance – Stasi officer HGW XX/7 – had removed the typewriter from his apartment and concealed his activities, including his authorship of the suicide article. He tracks down Wiesler, who now works delivering mail, but ultimately decides not to approach him.\\nTwo years later, Wiesler passes a bookstore window display promoting Dreyman\\'s new novel, Sonate vom Guten Menschen (\"Sonata for a Good Man\"). He opens a copy of the book, discovering that it is dedicated \"To HGW XX/7, in gratitude\". As he buys a copy, Wiesler is asked if he would like it giftwrapped. He replies: \"No, it\\'s for me.\"\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Sunset Blvd.': 'At a mansion on Sunset Boulevard, a group of police officers and photographers discover the body of Joe Gillis floating face down in the swimming pool. In a flashback, Joe relates the events leading to his death.\\nSix months earlier, Joe was a down-on-his-luck screenwriter trying to interest Paramount Pictures in a story he submitted. Script reader Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it, unaware that Joe is listening. Later, while fleeing from repossession men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion inhabited by forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond. Learning that Joe is a writer, Norma asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about Salome. She plans to play the role herself in her return to the screen. Joe finds her script abysmal but flatters her into hiring him as a script doctor.\\nMoved into Norma\\'s mansion at her insistence, Joe sees that Norma refuses to accept that her fame has evaporated, and he learns that her butler Max secretly writes the fan letters she receives. At her New Year\\'s Eve party, he realizes she has fallen in love with him. Joe tries to let her down gently, but Norma slaps him and retreats to her room. Joe visits his friend Artie Green and again meets Betty, who thinks a scene in one of Joe\\'s scripts has potential. When he phones Max to have him pack his things, Max tells him Norma cut her wrists with his razor. Joe returns to Norma, and their relationship becomes non-platonic.\\nNorma has Max deliver the edited Salome script to her former director Cecil B. DeMille at Paramount. She starts getting calls from Paramount executive Gordon Cole but refuses to speak to anyone except DeMille. Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to Paramount in her 1929 Isotta Fraschini. DeMille welcomes her affectionately and treats her with great respect, tactfully evading her questions about her script. Max learns that Cole wants to rent her unusual car for a film.\\nPreparing for her imagined comeback, Norma undergoes rigorous beauty treatments. Joe secretly works nights in Betty\\'s office, collaborating on an original screenplay. His moonlighting is found out by Max, who reveals that he was a respected film director who discovered Norma, made her a star, and was her first husband. After she divorced him, he abandoned his career to become her servant.\\nNorma discovers a manuscript with Joe\\'s and Betty\\'s names on it and phones Betty, insinuating that Joe is not the man he seems. Joe, overhearing, invites Betty to see for herself. When she arrives, he pretends he is satisfied being a kept man. However, after she tearfully leaves, he packs for a return to his old Ohio newspaper job. He bluntly informs Norma there will be no comeback; her fan mail comes from Max, and she has been forgotten. He disregards Norma\\'s threat to kill herself and the gun she shows him to back it up. As Joe leaves the house, Norma shoots him three times, and he falls into the pool.\\nThe flashback ends and the film returns to the present day, with Desmond about to be arrested for murder. Norma\\'s mansion is overrun with police and reporters. Having lost all touch with reality, Norma believes the newsreel cameras are there to film Salome instead. Max \"directs\" Norma for her scene and the police play along. As the cameras roll, Norma descends her grand staircase for her close up. Overcome with emotion, she stops and makes an impromptu speech about how happy she is to be making a film again. Norma continues walking towards the camera, a look of insanity in her eyes, her descent into madness complete. The scene fades to black.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Paths of Glory': 'In 1916, during World War I in Northern France, French General Georges Broulard asks his subordinate, General Paul Mireau, to take the Anthill, a well-defended German position. Mireau initially refuses, citing the impossibility of success. However, when Broulard mentions a potential promotion, Mireau quickly convinces himself the attack will succeed.\\nIn the trenches, Mireau throws a private out of the regiment for showing signs of shell shock. Mireau leaves the planning of the attack to Colonel Dax, despite Dax\\'s protests that the only result of the attack will be to weaken the French Army with heavy losses for no benefit.\\nBefore the attack, drunken Lieutenant Roget leads a night-time scouting mission, sending one of his two men ahead. Overcome by fear while waiting for the man\\'s return, Roget lobs a grenade, accidentally killing the scout. Corporal Paris, the other soldier on the mission, confronts Roget, who denies any wrongdoing and falsifies his report to Colonel Dax.\\nThe next morning, the attack on the Anthill is a failure. Dax leads the first wave of soldiers over the top into no man\\'s land under heavy fire. None of the men reach the German trenches, and B Company refuses to leave their own trench after seeing that violent defeat. Mireau, enraged, orders his artillery to open fire on them to force them onto the battlefield. The artillery commander refuses to fire without written confirmation of the order. Meanwhile, Dax returns to the trenches and tries to rally B Company to join the battle, but as he climbs out of the trench, the body of a dead French soldier knocks him down.\\nAt a meeting with Broulard and Dax, to deflect blame for the attack\\'s failure, Mireau decides to court-martial 100 of the soldiers for cowardice. Broulard orders Mireau to reduce the number and Mireau arrives at three, one from each company. Corporal Paris is chosen because his commanding officer Roget wishes to keep him from testifying about what happened in the scouting mission. Private Ferol is picked by his commanding officer because he is a \"social undesirable\". The last man, Private Arnaud, is chosen at random, despite having been cited for bravery twice previously.\\nDax, who was a criminal defense lawyer in civilian life, volunteers to defend the men at their court-martial. The trial, however, is a farce. There is no formal written indictment, a court stenographer is not present, and the court refuses to admit evidence that would support acquittal. In his closing statement, Dax denounces the proceedings. Nonetheless, the three are sentenced to death.\\nThe night before the execution, Dax confronts Broulard at a ball, with sworn statements by witnesses attesting to Mireau\\'s order to shell his own trenches, in an attempt to blackmail the General Staff into sparing the three men. Broulard takes the statements but brusquely dismisses Dax.\\nThe next morning, the three men are taken out to be shot by firing squad. Dax, suspecting Roget for his nomination of Paris, forces Roget to lead the executions. While a sobbing Ferol is blindfolded, Paris refuses Roget\\'s offer of a blindfold and reacts ambiguously to Roget\\'s meek apology. Arnaud, meanwhile, is so badly injured after fighting in prison that he must be carried out in a stretcher and tied to the post. All three men are executed.\\nFollowing the executions, Broulard breakfasts with the gloating Mireau. Broulard reveals he has invited Dax to attend and tells Mireau that he will be investigated for ordering to fire on his own men. Mireau storms out, protesting that he has been made a scapegoat. Broulard then blithely offers Mireau\\'s command to Dax, assuming that Dax\\'s attempts to stop the executions were a ploy to gain Mireau\\'s job. Discovering that Dax was in fact sincere, Broulard rebukes him for his idealism, while the disgusted Dax calls Broulard a \"degenerate, sadistic old man\".\\nAfter the execution, some of Dax\\'s soldiers are carousing at an inn.

The ghetto is now governed by Schultz who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime, which transformed into a fascist dictatorship under the ruthless Adenoid Hynkel.\\nThe Barber falls in love with a neighbor, Hannah, and together they try to resist persecution by military forces. The stormtroopers capture the Barber and are about to hang him, but Schultz recognizes him and restrains them. By recognizing him, and reminding him of World War I, Schultz helps the Barber regain his memory.\\nMeanwhile, Hynkel tries to finance his ever-growing military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker called Hermann Epstein, leading to a temporary ease on the restrictions on the ghetto. However, ultimately the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests against this inhumane policy and is sent to a concentration camp. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the Barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to assassinate Hynkel in a suicide attack, but they are dissuaded by Hannah. Troops search the ghetto, arrest Schultz and the Barber, and send both to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom at a vineyard in the neighboring country of Osterlich.\\nHynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, Benzino Napaloni, over which country should invade Osterlich. The two dictators argue over a treaty to govern the invasion, while dining together at an elaborate buffet, which happens to provide a jar of English mustard. The quarrel becomes heated and descends into a food fight, which is only resolved when both men eat the hot mustard and are shocked into cooperating. After signing the treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel orders the invasion of Osterlich. Hannah and her family are trapped by the invading force and beaten by a squad of arriving soldiers.\\n\\nEscaping from the camp in stolen uniforms, Schultz and the Barber, dressed as Hynkel, arrive at the Osterlich frontier, where a victory parade crowd is waiting to be addressed by Hynkel. The real Hynkel is mistaken for the Barber while out duck hunting in civilian clothes and is knocked out and taken to the camp. Schultz tells the Barber to go to the platform and impersonate Hynkel, as the only way to save their lives once they reach Osterlich\\'s capital. The Barber has never given a public speech in his life, but he has no other choice. He announces that he (as Hynkel) has had a change of heart, he makes an impassioned speech for brotherhood and goodwill, encouraging soldiers to fight for liberty, and unite the people in the name of democracy.\\nHe then addresses a message of hope to Hannah: \"Look up, Hannah. The soul of man has been given wings, and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow, into the light of hope, into the future, the glorious future that belongs to you, to me, and to all of us.\" Hannah hears the Barber\\'s voice on the radio. She turns toward the rising sunlight, and says to her fellows: \"Listen.\"\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Witness for the Prosecution': \"Senior barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, who is recovering from a heart attack, agrees to defend Leonard Vole despite the objections of Robarts' private nurse Miss Plimsoll, as Sir Wilfrid's doctor has warned him against taking any criminal cases. Vole is accused of murdering Emily French, a wealthy, childless widow who had become enamored of him and had named him as the main beneficiary in her will. Strong circumstantial evidence points to Vole as the killer, but Sir Wilfrid believes Vole to be innocent.\\nWhen Sir Wilfrid speaks with Vole's German wife Christine, he finds her rather cold and self-possessed, but she does provide an alibi, although it is not entirely convincing. He is greatly surprised when, during the trial, she is summoned as a witness by the prosecuting barrister.\\nWhile a wife cannot be compelled to testify against her husband, Christine was still married to Otto Helm, a German man now living in East Germany in the Russian Zone, when she wed Vole (who was in the Royal Air Force and part of the occupation forces in Germany and had married her to help her escape Germany). She testifies that Vole privately confessed to her that he had killed Mrs. French, and her conscience forced her to finally tell the truth.\\nDuring the trial in the Old Bailey, Sir Wilfrid is contacted by a mysterious woman who, for a fee, provides him with letters written by Christine to a mysterious lover named Max. The handwriting is genuine, and the woman has a legitimate reason for providing the letters: her face has been scarred and slashed, supposedly by Max. The letters include an account of Max and Christine's plan to kill Leonard, which convinces the jury that Christine had deliberately perjured herself. Leonard is acquitted, much to the crowd's delight.\\nHowever, Sir Wilfrid is troubled by the verdict. He is proved correct when Christine, brought into the courtroom for safety after being assailed by the departing crowd for her conduct, tells him that he had help winning the case. Sir Wilfrid had told her before the trial that any alibi contributed by a loving wife would not be believed by the jury. So she played a hateful, double-crossing wife and proffered testimony implicating her husband, and then forged the letters to the non-existent Max and assumed a disguise to play the mysterious woman who contributed the letters, discrediting her own testimony and leading to the acquittal. She admits that she saved Leonard, although she knew that he was guilty, because she loves him. She accepts that she may be tried for perjury.\\nLeonard, who has overheard Christine's admission, cheerfully confirms that he indeed killed Mrs. French. Sir Wilfrid is infuriated but helpless to stop Leonard because of double-jeopardy laws (since overturned in the United Kingdom) that would prevent a retrial. Christine is shocked to discover that Leonard has been in an affair with a younger woman for whom he plans to abandon Christine, feeling he and Christine are now even because they have saved each other's lives.\\nChristine angrily grabs a knife (used earlier as evidence and subtly highlighted by a reflection on Sir Wilfrid's monocle) and kills Leonard. After she is arrested by the police, Sir Wilfrid, urged on by Miss Plimsoll, declares that he will take on Christine's defense.\\n\\n\\n== Cast\", 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse': 'On Earth-65, police captain George Stacy is unaware that his daughter Gwen Stacy is Spider-Woman. Years prior, Gwen accidentally caused the death of her best friend Peter Parker while he was rampaging as the Lizard, and police have been hunting her ever since. One night, Gwen encounters a version of the Vulture from an Italian Renaissance-themed alternate universe. Miguel O\\'Hara and Jess Drew arrive using portal-generating watches and help Gwen neutralize the Vulture. George corners Gwen, who then reveals her identity to him; distraught, he attempts to arrest her. Miguel reluctantly grants Gwen membership into the Spider-Society, allowing her to escape with him and Jess.\\nIn Brooklyn on Earth-1610, sixteen months after the Alchemax collider\\'s destruction, Miles Morales encounters the Spot, an Alchemax scientist whose body was infused with portals during the collider explosion. The Spot blames Miles for causing his condition and reveals that, while testing the collider, he had transported a spider from another dimension, Earth-42, which bit Miles and turned him into Spider-Man. The Spot then accidentally transports himself into a void, where he travels to other universes containing Alchemax colliders to empower himself further.\\nGwen travels to Earth-1610 and reconnects with Miles while secretly tracking the Spot. Miles secretly follows her through a portal to Earth-50101, and they team up with local Spider-Man Pavitr Prabhakar, and later Hobie Brown, against the Spot, who absorbs the power of that world\\'s collider. The Spot and Miles share a vision of the Spot\\'s future attacks that include the deaths of Police Inspector Singh (the father of Pavitr\\'s girlfriend) and Miles\\' father Jeff. As the collider collapses, Miles saves Singh, but Earth-50101 begins falling apart from its disrupted \"canon event\" before members of the Spider-Society arrive to contain the damage. Miles, Gwen, and Hobie are sent to the Society\\'s headquarters on Earth-928, where hundreds of Spider-People reside in a massive complex.\\nMiles, Gwen, and Hobie meet with Miguel and reunite with Peter B. Parker and his infant daughter Mayday. Miguel explains to Miles that each of the Spider-People\\'s stories throughout the multiverse entails \"canon events\", such as the deaths of a police captain close to Spider-Man and an uncle figure to Spider-Man, as well as other string of events that define a Spider-Man; and straying from these events threatens reality and may cause that universe to collapse, which in turn will collapse the entire multiverse as a consequence. Miguel reveals he witnessed the collapse of another universe firsthand when attempting to replace a deceased version of himself from that universe.\\nMiles realizes that the Spot murdering Jeff, who is set to be promoted to police captain in two days, is a canon event. Miguel imprisons Miles to prevent him from saving Jeff, but Hobie helps Miles break loose before quitting the Society. As Miles flees through the complex, Miguel orders the Society to capture him. Miguel corners Miles and tells him that he is the original anomaly; Miles was never supposed to be Spider-Man, as the spider that bit him came from Earth-42, resulting in Earth-42 having no Spider-Man, and that if the spider had not bitten Miles, Earth-1610\\'s Peter Parker would have stopped the collider and survived, and the Spot would never have existed.\\nMiles overpowers Miguel and flees to what he believes to be his home dimension. Considering Gwen a liability, a furious Miguel ejects her from the Society and forcibly sends her back to Earth-65. Once there, Gwen learns that George has resigned from his job as police captain, and she realises that in doing so, her canon event has been safely averted. The two reconcile, and George gives Gwen a portal watch left by Hobie.\\nTo his shock, Miles realizes that he is on Earth-42, the home of the spider that bit him, rather than his own dimension. In this world, his uncle Aaron Davis is alive while his father Jeff is dead, and because Spider-Man does not exist, New York City is riddled with unchecked crime. As the Society searches for Miles in his home dimension, Gwen travels to Earth-1610 and speaks with Miles\\' parents, promising to find him and bring him home. Earth-42\\'s Aaron restrains Miles, and it is revealed that Earth-42\\'s Miles has become the Prowler.\\nAs the Spot begins his multiversal attack, Gwen assembles a team to find Miles, consisting of Peter B., Mayday, Pavitr, Hobie, Margo Kess, Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham, while Miles prepares to escape.\\n\\n\\n== Voice cast', 'Aliens': \"Ellen Ripley has been in stasis for 57 years aboard an escape shuttle after destroying her ship, the Nostromo, to escape an alien creature that slaughtered the rest of the crew. She is rescued and debriefed by her employers at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, who are skeptical about her claim of alien eggs in a derelict ship on the exomoon LV-426, since it is now the site of a terraforming colony.\\nAfter contact is lost with the colony, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany them to investigate. Still traumatized by her alien encounter, she agrees on the condition that they exterminate the creatures. Ripley is introduced to the Colonial Marines on the spaceship Sulaco but is distrustful of their android, Bishop, because the android aboard the Nostromo betrayed its crew to protect the alien on company orders.\\nA dropship delivers the expedition to the surface of LV-426, where they find the battle-ravaged colony and two live alien facehuggers in containment tanks, but no bodies or colonists except for a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt. The team locates the colonists beneath the fusion-powered atmosphere processing station and heads to their location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions. At the station center, the Marines find opened eggs and dead facehuggers alongside the cocooned colonists now serving as incubators for the creatures' offspring. The Marines kill an infant alien after it bursts from a colonist's chest, rousing several adult aliens who ambush the Marines and kill or capture many of them. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command, takes control of their armored personnel carrier, and rams the nest to rescue Corporal Dwayne Hicks and Privates Hudson and Vasquez. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots, and it crashes into the station. Almost out of ammunition and resources, the survivors barricade themselves inside the colony.\\nRipley discovers that Burke ordered the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship containing the alien eggs, intending to profit by recovering them for biological weapon research. Before she can expose him, Bishop informs the group that the dropship crash damaged the power-plant cooling system and the plant will soon overheat and explode, destroying the colony. He volunteers to travel to the colony transmitter and remotely pilot the Sulaco's remaining dropship to the surface.\\nAfter falling asleep in the medical laboratory, Ripley and Newt awaken to find themselves trapped with the two released facehuggers. Ripley triggers a fire alarm to alert the Marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. She accuses Burke of releasing the facehuggers to implant her and Newt with alien embryos, allowing him to smuggle them through Earth's quarantine. The power is suddenly cut, and aliens attack through the ceiling. In the ensuing firefight, the aliens kill Burke, subdue Hudson, and injure Hicks; the cornered Gorman and Vasquez sacrifice themselves to avoid capture. Newt is separated from Ripley and taken by the creatures. Ripley brings Hicks to Bishop in the second dropship, but she refuses to abandon Newt and arms herself before descending into the processing station hive alone to rescue her. During their escape, they encounter the alien queen surrounded by dozens of eggs, and when one begins to open, Ripley uses her weapons to destroy them all and the queen's ovipositor. Pursued by the enraged queen, Ripley and Newt join Bishop and Hicks on the dropship and escape moments before the station explodes, consuming the colony in a nuclear blast.\\nAboard the Sulaco, the group is ambushed by the queen, who stowed away in the dropship's landing gear. The queen tears Bishop in half and advances on Newt, but Ripley fights the creature with an exosuit cargo loader and expels it through an airlock into space while the damaged Bishop keeps Newt safe. Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop enter hypersleep for their return trip to Earth.\\n\\n\\n== Cast\", 'American Beauty': \"Middle-aged media executive Lester Burnham hates his job and is unhappily married to neurotic and ambitious real estate agent Carolyn.

The planes are on airborne alert two hours from their targets inside the USSR.\\nGeneral Ripper orders his executive officer, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (an exchange officer from the Royal Air Force), to put the base on alert, confiscate all privately owned radios from base personnel and issue \"Wing Attack Plan R\" to the patrolling bombers. All the aircraft commence attack flights on the USSR and set their radios to allow communications only through their CRM 114 discriminators, which are designed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper. Happening upon a radio that had been missed earlier and hearing regular civilian broadcasting, Mandrake realizes that no attack order has been issued by the Pentagon and tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have been fluoridating American water supplies to pollute the \"precious bodily fluids\" of Americans. Mandrake realizes Ripper has become insane.\\n\\nIn the War Room at the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson briefs President Merkin Muffley and other officers about how \"Plan R\" enables a senior officer to launch a retaliatory nuclear attack on the Soviets if all superiors have been killed in a first strike on the United States. Trying every CRM code combination to issue a recall order would require two days, so Muffley orders the U.S. Army to storm the base and arrest General Ripper. Turgidson, noting the slim odds of recalling the planes in time, then proposes that Muffley not only let the attack proceed but send reinforcements. According to an unofficial study, this would result in \"modest and acceptable civilian casualties\" from the \"badly damaged and uncoordinated\" Soviet military remaining after the initial attack. Muffley rejects Turgidson\\'s recommendation and instead brings Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadeski into the War Room to telephone Soviet Premier Dimitri Kissov on the \"hotline\". Muffley warns the Premier of the impending attack and offers to reveal the targets, flight plans, and defensive systems of the bombers so that the Soviets can protect themselves.\\nAfter a heated discussion with the Premier, the ambassador informs President Muffley that the Soviet Union created a doomsday machine as a nuclear deterrent; it consists of many buried bombs jacketed with \"cobalt–thorium G\", which are set to detonate automatically should any nuclear attack strike the country. The resulting nuclear fallout would then engulf the planet for 93 years, rendering the Earth\\'s surface uninhabitable. The device cannot be deactivated, as it is programmed to explode if any such attempt is made. The President\\'s German wheelchair-using scientific advisor, former Nazi Dr. Strangelove, points out that such a doomsday machine would only be an effective deterrent if everyone knew about it; de Sadeski replies that the Soviet Premier had planned to reveal its existence to the world the following week at the Party Congress.\\nU.S. Army troops arrive at Burpelson and battle with the garrison. After General Ripper commits suicide, Mandrake identifies Ripper\\'s CRM code from doodles on his desk blotter and relays it to the Pentagon. Using the code, Strategic Air Command successfully recalls all of the bombers except for one, commanded by Major T. J. \"King\" Kong, due to the radio equipment being damaged by a Soviet SAM. The Soviets hunt the bomber, but Kong flies below radar and switches targets due to dwindling fuel. As the plane approaches the new target, a Soviet ICBM site, the crew is unable to open the damaged bomb bay doors. Kong enters the bay and repairs the electrical wiring while straddling an H-bomb, after that the doors open, and the bomb is dropped. Kong joyously hoots and waves his cowboy hat as he rides the falling bomb to his death.\\nIn the War Room, Dr. Strangelove recommends that the President gather several hundred thousand people to live in deep underground mines where the radiation will not penetrate. He suggests a 10:1 female-to-male ratio for a breeding program to repopulate the Earth once the radiation has subsided. Worried that the Soviets will do the same, Turgidson warns about a \"mineshaft gap\" while de Sadeski secretly photographs the War Room.

A young priest, Father Vogler, approaches Salieri for elaboration on the latter\\'s confession. Salieri plays two of his own melodies; Vogler admits that he doesn\\'t know them. Salieri then plays Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, which Vogler knows perfectly well. Unsurprised that Vogler knows this melody but not his, Salieri recounts how, ever since he could remember, he desired to be a composer, much to his father\\'s chagrin. He prays to God that if He allowed Salieri to become a famous composer, he would, in return, promise his faithfulness, chastity and diligence. Soon after, his father chokes on his food and dies, which Salieri takes as a sign that God has accepted his vow. By 1774, Salieri had become court composer to Emperor Joseph II in Vienna. \\nSeven years later, at a reception in honour of Mozart\\'s patron, the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, Salieri anxiously awaits to meet his idol, guessing his identity. He is shocked to discover that the transcendentally talented Mozart is obscene, silly, and immature. Salieri, a devout Catholic, cannot fathom why God would endow such a great gift onto Mozart instead of him and concludes that God is using Mozart\\'s talent to make Salieri a mediocrity. Salieri renounces God and vows to take revenge on Him by destroying Mozart.\\nMeanwhile, Mozart\\'s alcoholism ruins his health, marriage, finances and reputation at court, even as he continues to produce brilliant work. Salieri hires a young girl to work as Mozart\\'s maid (against Mozart’s father Leopold\\'s better judgment) so he may gain access to his apartment, where he discovers that Mozart is working on an opera based on the play The Marriage of Figaro, which the Emperor has forbidden, owing to its subversive theme. When Mozart is summoned to court to explain, he manages to convince the Emperor to allow his opera to premiere, despite Salieri and the advisors\\' attempts at sabotage. When Mozart is informed that his father has died, he writes Don Giovanni in his grief.\\nSalieri recognizes the dead commander in the opera as symbolic of Mozart\\'s father and concocts a scheme; he leads Mozart to believe that his father has risen to commission a Requiem. He then plans to kill Mozart once the piece is finished and premiere it at Mozart\\'s funeral, claiming the work as his own. Meanwhile, Mozart\\'s friend Emanuel Schikaneder invites him to write an opera for his theatre. Mozart obliges, despite his wife Constanze\\'s insistence that he finish the Requiem, as the opera is a riskier venture. After arguing with Mozart, Constanze leaves with their young son, Karl.\\nThe opera in question, The Magic Flute, is a great success, but the overworked Mozart collapses during one performance. Salieri takes him home and persuades him to continue writing the Requiem, offering to take the bedridden Mozart\\'s dictation; the two lay down the opening of the Confutatis together. The next morning, Mozart thanks Salieri for his friendship, and Salieri admits that Mozart is the greatest composer he knows. Constanze returns and, appalled at finding Mozart working with Salieri, demands that Salieri leave immediately. In her guilt, she locks the unfinished Requiem away in a cabinet, keeping it away from both composers. Constanze and Salieri argue with each other, before she walks over to Mozart\\'s bed to find that he has died. Mozart is taken out of the city on a rainy day and is unceremoniously buried in a mass grave.\\nBack in 1823, Vogler is too shaken to absolve Salieri, who surmised that the \"merciful\" God preferred to destroy His beloved Mozart rather than allow Salieri to share in the smallest part of his glory.

The toys become uneasy when Andy has his birthday party a week early. Sheriff Woody, Andy\\'s favorite toy and their de facto leader, sends Sarge and his green army men to spy on the gift opening with a baby monitor. The other toys (which include Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex the tyrannosaur, Hamm the piggy bank, and Bo Peep the porcelain doll) are relieved when Andy receives nothing that could replace them. However, Andy receives a last-minute surprise gift – a Buzz Lightyear action figure who believes he is an actual Space Ranger. Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features and becomes Andy\\'s new favorite toy, making Woody jealous.\\nTwo days before the move, Andy\\'s family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet, where Andy is allowed to bring along only one toy; to ensure Andy chooses him and not Buzz, Woody tries using the radio-controlled car RC to knock Buzz behind the desk, but accidentally knocks him out the open bedroom window instead. Most of the other toys believe Woody deliberately tried to kill Buzz, but Andy arrives and takes Woody before they can exact revenge. A furious Buzz stows away in the car, and confronts Woody when the car stops at a gas station on the way to Pizza Planet. The two fight, fall out of the car, and are left behind.\\nAfter a further argument, the two hitch a ride on a Pizza Planet delivery truck and sneak into the restaurant. Buzz mistakenly believes a claw crane full of Little Green Men to be a true rocket, and Woody climbs in after him. Andy\\'s sadistic next-door neighbor Sid spots and captures the two and takes them to his house, where they encounter his Bull Terrier Scud and his much-abused \"mutant\" toys made from parts of other toys he has destroyed.\\nAs Woody tries to find an escape route, Buzz is shocked by a TV commercial that reveals he is indeed a toy. He attempts to fly, but breaks his arm off and has a mental breakdown. After Sid\\'s toys fix Buzz, Sid returns and tapes Buzz to a rocket, but a thunderstorm forces him to delay the launch until the next morning. Overnight, Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is making Andy happy, restoring Buzz\\'s resolve. Sid takes Buzz out to launch him, but Woody rallies the mutant toys to frighten Sid into never harming toys again, freeing Buzz.\\nWoody and Buzz pursue Andy\\'s moving truck, but Scud sees them and gives chase, biting Woody. Buzz fights off Scud, while Woody, freed, climbs into the truck and pushes RC out, using him to distract Scud and rescue Buzz. The other toys, thinking Woody is now trying to get rid of RC as well, toss Woody back into the street. Having escaped Scud, Buzz and Woody pursue the truck on RC, and the other toys spot them coming and realize their error. During the chase, RC\\'s batteries run out, forcing Woody to ignite the rocket still strapped to Buzz. As they launch towards the truck, they become airborne, and Woody drops RC into the truck. Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes; he and Woody glide over the truck and fall through the sunroof of Andy\\'s car, landing safely beside Andy.\\nAt Christmas, in the new house, Sarge and his men spy on the gift opening again while the other toys wait. Mr. Potato Head is delighted when Molly gets a Mrs. Potato Head, and Woody and Buzz jokingly ponder what gift could be \"worse\" than Buzz, only to nervously smile at each other when Andy gets a dachshund puppy named Buster.\\n\\n\\n== Voice cast', 'Braveheart': 'In 1280, King Edward \"Longshanks\" invades and conquers Scotland following the death of the Scots king Alexander III, who left no heir to the throne. Young William Wallace witnesses Longshanks\\'s execution of several Scottish nobles, suffers the deaths of his father and brother fighting against the English, and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal uncle Argyle, who has Wallace educated.\\nYears later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including ius primae noctis. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace returns to Scotland, rekindles the love with his childhood sweetheart Murron MacClannough, and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as Wallace fights off the soldiers, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to fight the English garrison in his hometown and sends the surviving garrison back to England with a message of rebellion for Longshanks.\\nLongshanks orders his son Prince Edward to stop Wallace by any means necessary while he visits the French King to secure England\\'s alliance with France. Alongside his friend Hamish, Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge, where he decapitates the English commander Cheltham, and sacks York after Prince Edward fails to send reinforcements there, killing Longshanks\\'s nephew whose severed head is sent to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of Robert the Bruce, the son of nobleman Robert the Elder, a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his leper father, who wishes to secure the Scottish throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son\\'s wife Isabella of France to try to negotiate with Wallace as a distraction for the landing of another invasion force in Scotland.\\nAfter meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored with Wallace. She warns him of the coming invasion, and Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate action to counter the threat and take back their country, asking Robert the Bruce to lead. Leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at Falkirk. During the battle, Scottish noblemen Mornay and Lochlan, having been bribed by Longshanks, withdraw their men, resulting in Wallace\\'s army being routed and the death of Hamish\\'s father, Campbell. Wallace is further betrayed when he discovers Robert the Bruce was fighting alongside Longshanks; after the battle, seeing the damage he helped do to his countrymen, Robert reprimands his father and vows never to be on the wrong side again.\\nWallace kills Lochlan and Mornay for their betrayal and wages a guerrilla war against the English, assisted by Isabella, with whom he eventually has an affair. Robert sets up a meeting with Wallace in Edinburgh, but Robert\\'s father conspires with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert disowns and banishes his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks, who can no longer speak, by telling him that his bloodline will be destroyed upon his death as she is pregnant with Wallace\\'s child and will ensure that Prince Edward spends as short a time as possible on the throne before Wallace\\'s child replaces him.\\nIn London, Wallace is brought before an English magistrate, tried for high treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being disemboweled alive, Wallace refuses to submit to the king. The watching crowd, deeply moved by the Scotsman\\'s valor, begin crying for mercy on Wallace\\'s behalf. The magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word, \"Mercy\", and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, \"Freedom!\", and his cry rings through the square, the dying Longshanks hearing it at his final breath. Before being beheaded, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him.\\nIn 1314, Robert, now Scotland\\'s king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of Bannockburn, where he is supposed to formally accept English rule. Instead, he invokes Wallace\\'s memory, imploring his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. Hamish throws Wallace\\'s sword point-down in front of the English army, and he and the Scots chant Wallace\\'s name as Robert leads them into battle against the English, winning the Scots their freedom.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Das Boot': \"Lieutenant Werner is a war correspondent on the German submarine U-96 in October 1941. He is driven by her captain and chief engineer to a raucous French bordello, where he meets some of the crew. Thomsen, another captain, gives a crude drunken speech to celebrate his Ritterkreuz award, in which he mocks Adolf Hitler.\\nThe next morning, U-96 sails out of the harbour of La Rochelle, and Werner is given a tour of the boat. As time passes, he observes ideological differences between the new crew members and the hardened veterans, particularly the captain, who is embittered and cynical about the war. The new men, including Werner, are mocked by the rest of the crew, who share a tight bond. One Nazi officer, 1-WO (the first [watch] officer), is disliked by the others due to his pro-Nazi beliefs and meticulous grooming habits that hogs up the one bathroom that the entire crew has to share. After days of boredom, the crew is excited by another U-boat's spotting of an enemy convoy, but they are soon spotted by a British destroyer and bombarded with depth charges. They escape with only light damage.\\nThe next three weeks are spent enduring a relentless North Atlantic gale. Morale drops after a series of misfortunes, but the crew is cheered temporarily by a chance encounter with Thomsen's boat. Shortly after the storm ends, the boat encounters a British convoy and quickly launches three torpedoes, sinking two ships. They are spotted by a destroyer and have to dive below test depth, the submarine's rated limit. During the ensuing depth-charge attack, the chief machinist, Johann, panics and has to be restrained. The boat sustains heavy damage, but is eventually able to safely surface when night falls. A British tanker they torpedoed is still afloat and on fire, so they torpedo it again, only to learn sailors are still aboard. The crew watches in horror as the sailors leap overboard and swim towards them. Unwilling to accommodate prisoners, the captain orders the boat to back away.\\nThe worn-out U-boat crew looks forward to returning home to La Rochelle in time for Christmas, but the ship is ordered to La Spezia, Italy, which means passing through the Strait of Gibraltar—an area heavily defended by the Royal Navy. The U-boat makes a secret night rendezvous at the harbour of Vigo, in neutral although Axis-friendly Spain, with the SS Weser, an interned German merchant ship that clandestinely provides U-boats with fuel, torpedoes, and other supplies. The filthy officers seem out of place at the opulent dinner prepared for them, but are warmly greeted by enthusiastic officers eager to hear their exploits. The captain learns from an envoy of the German consulate that his request for Werner and the chief engineer to be sent back to Germany has been denied.\\nThe crew finishes resupplying and departs for Italy. As they carefully approach the Strait of Gibraltar and are just about to dive, they are suddenly attacked and heavily damaged by a British fighter plane, wounding the navigator, Kriechbaum. The captain orders the boat directly south towards the North African coast at full speed, determined to save his crew even if he loses the boat. British warships begin shelling and they are forced to dive. When attempting to level off, the boat does not respond and continues to sink until, just before being crushed by the pressure, it lands on a sea shelf, at the depth of 280 metres. The crew works desperately to make numerous repairs before running out of oxygen. After over 16 hours, they are able to surface by blowing their ballast tanks, and limp back towards La Rochelle under cover of darkness.\\nThe crew is exhausted when they finally reach La Rochelle on Christmas Eve. Shortly after Kriechbaum is taken ashore to a waiting ambulance, Allied planes bomb and strafe the facilities, wounding or killing many of the crew. Ullmann, Johann, the second watch officer, and the Bibelforscher are killed. Frenssen, Bootsmann Lamprecht, and Hinrich are wounded. After the raid, Werner leaves the U-boat bunker in which he had taken shelter and finds the captain, badly injured by shrapnel, watching his U-boat sink in the dock. Just after the boat disappears under the water, the captain collapses and dies. Werner rushes to his body, and surveys the grim scene with tears in his eyes.\\n\\n\\n== Cast\", 'Joker': 'A clown and aspiring stand-up comedian named Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in crime-ridden Gotham City during the early 1980s recession.

After Arthur is attacked by street urchins, his co-worker Randall gives him a revolver for self-defense. Arthur pursues a relationship with his neighbor, single mother Sophie, and invites her to see his routine at a comedy club.\\nArthur is fired from his job at a children\\'s hospital when he accidentally exposes the gun despite his explanation that it was given to him by Randall, who denies this. While riding home on the subway still wearing his clown makeup, Arthur is mocked and beaten by drunk businessmen from Wayne Investments; he fatally shoots two of them in self-defense and murders the third as he attempts to flee. The killings are condemned by their employer, billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, but protesters begin donning clown masks in Arthur\\'s image. Budget cuts shut down the social service program, leaving Arthur without his medication.\\nSophie attends Arthur\\'s stand-up routine, which goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably, and his jokes fall flat. Arthur intercepts a letter from Penny to Thomas, alleging that he is Thomas\\'s illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth. He goes to Wayne Manor, where he meets Thomas\\'s young son Bruce, but flees after a scuffle with family butler Alfred Pennyworth. Penny suffers a stroke and is hospitalized. Arthur\\'s idol, popular late-night talk show host Murray Franklin, presents clips of Arthur\\'s failed performance on his show and mockingly calls him a \"joker\".\\nArthur confronts Thomas at a film theatre. Thomas tells him that he is not his father, and Penny is not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits Arkham State Hospital and steals Penny\\'s file, which states she was a narcissist who adopted Arthur while working as a housekeeper for the Waynes in the 1950s. Penny then raised Arthur with her abusive boyfriend, who later died in jail. Penny was sent to Arkham for allowing the abuse. Distraught, Arthur enters Sophie\\'s apartment unannounced. Frightened, Sophie asks him to leave, revealing their relationship to be a figment of Arthur\\'s imagination. The following day, Arthur smothers Penny to death at the hospital.\\nAfter his stand-up clips go viral, Arthur is invited to appear on Murray\\'s show. He subsequently plans suicide during the broadcast. While crafting a clown-inspired persona, he is visited by Randall and another ex-colleague, Gary.

Two detectives investigating Arthur\\'s involvement in the murders of the businessmen pursue him onto a subway filled with clown protesters. One detective accidentally shoots and kills a protester, thus inciting a riot, while Arthur escapes.\\nBefore the show goes live, Arthur asks Murray to introduce him as \"Joker\", a reference to his earlier mockery. Arthur behaves lewdly, tells morbid jokes, confesses to the subway murders, rants about how society abandons the downtrodden and mentally ill, and berates Murray for ridiculing him. After one more morbid joke, Arthur fatally shoots him on air. He is arrested, and riots erupt across the city. One of the rioters corners the Wayne family in an alley and murders Thomas and his wife, sparing Bruce. Rioters in an ambulance crash into the police car carrying Arthur, freeing him; he stands atop the car, starts to dance to the cheers of the crowd, and smears blood on his face into the shape of a smile.\\nAt Arkham, Arthur laughs to himself about a joke while with a therapist, but declines to tell it, claiming she would not understand it. He leaves behind a trail of bloodied shoeprints as he is chased down a corridor by an orderly.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Avengers: Endgame': \"In 2018, twenty-three days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe, Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and they reunite with the remaining Avengers—Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes—and Rocket on Earth.

The village's wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands that the demon came from, and that he cannot return to his homeland.\\nHeading west, Ashitaka meets Jigo, an opportunistic monk who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a deer-like animal god by day and a giant Night Walker by night. Nearby, men on a cliffside herd oxen to their home of Iron Town, led by Lady Eboshi, and repel an attack by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro, whom Eboshi wounds with a gun shot.

When Professor Gerald Lambeau posts a difficult combinatorial mathematics problem on a blackboard as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the students and Lambeau. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem; he later catches Will writing the solution on the blackboard late at night, but initially thinks Will is vandalizing it and chases him off. At a bar, Will meets Skylar, a British woman about to graduate from Harvard College, who plans on attending medical school at Stanford.\\nThe next day, Will and his friends get in a fight with a gang that includes a member who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for Will to avoid jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau\\'s supervision and participate in psychotherapy sessions. Will agrees but treats his therapists with mockery. In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology at Bunker Hill Community College. Unlike other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will\\'s defense mechanisms. During the first session, Will insults Sean\\'s deceased wife, and Sean threatens him, but after a few unproductive sessions, Will finally begins to open up.\\nWill is particularly struck by Sean\\'s story of how he met his wife, who later died of cancer, by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the 1975 World Series after falling in love at first sight. Sean\\'s explanation for surrendering his ticket was to \"see about a girl\", and he does not regret his decision.

Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling Will he owes it to his friends to make the most of the opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day.

Max foils one of their robberies but has the booty stolen from him by a corrupt police officer, Whitey. Later, they blackmail the officer, catching him having sex with Peggy, a prostitute, and the five youngsters start a gang with the same level of police protection as Bugsy. Max and Noodles become best friends.\\nThe group rises through the ranks after implementing Noodles\\' idea to hide bootleg liquor. They stash half their earnings in a railway station locker, giving the key to \"Fat Moe\", a friend not directly involved in their activities.

His first job with them is a diamond heist using a jewelry employee and occasional prostitute named Carol as their informant. During the robbery, Carol goads Noodles into hitting her, after which he rapes her; she later goes on to become Max\\'s moll. That the job had been commissioned by a Syndicate figure to eliminate the competition sits badly with Noodles who, unlike Max, dislikes hierarchy and lacks political ambition.

While in Mitsuha\\'s body, Taki accompanies Mitsuha\\'s grandmother Hitoha and younger sister Yotsuha to the Shinto shrine on a mountain near Itomori, leaving an offering of kuchikamizake made with Mitsuha\\'s spit. Hitoha explains that god is the ruler over both time and the connections between humans. Mitsuha tells Taki that the comet Tiamat is expected to pass nearest to Earth on the day of the autumn festival. The next day, Taki goes on the date with Miki in his own body; Miki enjoys the date but says she can tell Taki is preoccupied with someone else. Realizing he is falling for Mitsuha, Taki attempts to call her on the phone but cannot reach her. The body-switching stops as inexplicably as it started.\\nTaki, Miki, and their friend Tsukasa travel to Hida to search for Mitsuha. Taki does not know the name of Mitsuha\\'s village, so he sketches the landscape from memory; a restaurant owner in Takayama recognizes the town as Itomori and offers to take Taki and his friends. When they arrive, they find the town almost entirely decimated by fragments that fell from Tiamat. Since the comet passed three years earlier, Taki realizes that he and Mitsuha were separated by three years, her living in 2013 and he in 2016. He finds Mitsuha\\'s name among the 500 people killed by the comet\\'s impact. Taki begins to lose his memories of Mitsuha, seeing her messages disappear from his phone. In a panic, he races to the shrine and drinks the kuchikamizake. He has a vision and recalls that Mitsuha once came to Tokyo to find him; though he did not recognize her, she gave him a ribbon he has worn ever since. Taki awakens in Mitsuha\\'s body on the morning of the festival, where Hitoha speaks directly to him, explaining that the body-switching phenomenon has always been in their family. Realizing he has a chance to save Mitsuha and the entire town, Taki convinces Mitsuha\\'s friends to help him broadcast an emergency signal, evacuating Itomori before the meteor fragments strike. He then heads to the shrine, where Mitsuha has just woken up in Taki\\'s body. As twilight falls; their timelines cross, allowing them to meet in person for the first time. Taki returns Mitsuha\\'s ribbon, and they attempt to write their names on each other\\'s palms, but twilight ends before Mitsuha can write hers.\\nShe returns to the village to see that the evacuation plan failed but convinces her father, the mayor, to order an evacuation. Beginning to forget Taki, she discovers that he wrote \"I love you\" on her hand instead of his name. Taki awakens in his own time with no memory. Five years later, Taki is a university graduate struggling to find a job. He is obsessed with the impact of Tiamat, when the villagers of Itomori were miraculously saved by a fortuitous evacuation drill, but cannot remember why. One day, he glimpses Mitsuha, who has moved to Tokyo; they race to find each other. As they pass the stairs of a shrine, Taki calls out to Mitsuha, and the two simultaneously ask each other for their name.\\n\\n\\n== Characters', '3 Idiots': 'In their first year of college, students Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi join the prestigious Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi and meet Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad (\"Rancho\"), their roommate. Rancho is passionate about experimenting and consequently tops the class. Rancho\\'s playful attitude to engineering puts him at odds with the rigid approach of the college\\'s director, Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe (nicknamed \"Virus\" by the students).\\nWhen a student named Joy Lobo is denied graduation by  Virus on the ground of failure to submit the project, then Rancho tries to finish Joy’s project. Joy commits sucide before he can show it to him. Rancho confronts Virus about the extreme pressure placed on ICE students, but is rudely rebuffed. One night, the trio gatecrashes a wedding party, not knowing that it is for Virus\\'s daughter Mona.  Mona\\'s younger sister, Pia, is initially upset by Rancho’s behaviour, but then gets attracted to him after he pranks her materialistic boyfriend Suhas to demonstrate his obsession with money and status. Pia breaks up with Suhas after he scolds her for wearing a cheap watch, which belonged to her mother. An infuriated Virus warns Farhan and Raju about the effects of them being friends with Rancho by pointing out the modest financial situations of their families, scaring Raju into bunking with Chatur \"Silencer\" Ramalingam, a competitive, arrogant Tamil student who believes in learning by rote memorisation but is not fluent in Hindi. To teach Chatur a lesson about memorisation, Rancho and Farhan secretly make obscene modifications to the all-Hindi Teachers Day speech that Chatur is to deliver in honour of a visit by the Minister of Education. Humiliated and furious, Chatur challenges Rancho to meet in ten years and see who is more successful. The night before their final exams, Raju\\'s paralyzed father experiences a heart attack. With Pia\\'s help, Rancho rushes Raju\\'s father to the hospital on Pia\\'s scooter. Raju is initially furious at Rancho, but upon realising that Rancho saved his father\\'s life, Raju reconciles with him. At the end of the year, Rancho comes first in the class, while Farhan and Raju are last and second to last, respectively. During the yearly class photo, Rancho makes a bet with Virus that if either Raju or Farhan gets a job from on-campus interviews, Virus will shave his mustache.\\nOne night in their fourth year of college, Rancho tells his friends why they consistently place last: Farhan\\'s passion is photography, not engineering, and Raju lacks self-confidence. After Farhan and Raju promise to confront their problems if Rancho confesses his feelings for Pia, the three of them drunkenly break into Virus\\' house, and while exfiltrating, Farhan and Raju drunkenly urinate on his letterbox. Virus spots them during their escape, recognising Raju, and the next day gives Raju an ultimatum: to incriminate his friends or be expelled himself. Distraught, Raju attempts suicide but survives, leading to Virus revoking the expulsion. Raju recovers, thanks to the support and care of his friends and family. Raju is successful in a job interview, while Farhan convinces his father to let him become a photographer. Virus then tries to destroy Raju\\'s chances of success by setting an unfairly difficult exam. With Pia\\'s help, Rancho and Farhan break into Virus\\' office and steal the exam paper. Upon being given the paper, Raju refuses to cheat and throws it away, but the three of them are caught and expelled. Pia confronts her father over her brother\\'s suicide, which was prompted by similar pressure placed on him by Virus. That night, during a heavy rainstorm, Mona, who is pregnant, goes into labour. Unable to drive to a hospital, Rancho modifies a vacuum cleaner into a ventouse and delivers the baby with the help of Pia, Farhan, and Raju. A grateful Virus acknowledges Rancho by giving him a valuable space pen, which he promised to give only to his most distinguished student, and revokes the trio\\'s expulsions. On graduation day, Rancho suddenly disappears.\\nTen years later, Chatur, now the prosperous vice-president of a reputable company in California, calls Farhan and Raju to remind them of the bet he made with Rancho about who would be more successful. Farhan, who is on a flight at the time, feigns a medical emergency in order to meet up with Chatur and Raju. The three of them set out to find Rancho. Upon reaching Shimla, where Chatur has located Rancho\\'s house, they come across a different man named Ranchhoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad, whose face is pasted over Rancho\\'s in their graduation portrait. The man is reluctant to reveal anything at first and threatens the trio at gunpoint, only relenting after Farhan and Raju threaten to flush his late father\\'s ashes down a toilet. He explains that the \"Rancho\" at ICE was his family\\'s gardener\\'s son \"Chhote\", who was incredibly intelligent and gifted. Ranchhoddas\\' father paid for Chhote to attend ICE, on condition that he use his son\\'s name and, after graduating, cut all contact with anyone at ICE. Chhote, who was more interested in learning than in getting a degree, agreed, but afterward warned that two idiots would come looking for him one day. Ranchoddas tells the trio that he is grateful for what Chhote did, and gives them Chhote/Rancho\\'s address in Ladakh. On the way there, Farhan and Raju gatecrash Pia\\'s wedding to Suhas in Manali and convince her to come with them to find Rancho. \\nAt the address in Ladakh, the group is astonished to find a thriving school. They reunite with \"Millimetre\", formerly an errand boy whom they met at ICE, now Rancho\\'s assistant, who tells them that Rancho has keenly followed their careers. They reunite with Rancho on a sandbar. Rancho admits he is still in love with Pia and the two share a kiss. Chatur assumes that Rancho is a mere schoolteacher and mocks him, but Rancho reveals himself to be Phunsukh Wangdu, a successful entrepreneur with 400 patents, whom Chatur\\'s company is courting. A shocked Chatur accepts defeat as the others run away from him laughing.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'High and Low': 'A wealthy executive named Kingo Gondo (Toshiro Mifune) is in a struggle to gain control of a company called National Shoes. One faction wants the company to make cheap, low-quality shoes for the impulse market as opposed to the sturdy and high-quality shoes currently being produced. Gondo believes that the long-term future of the company will be best served by well-made shoes with modern styling, though this plan is unpopular because it means lower profits in the short term. He has secretly set up a leveraged buyout to gain control of the company, mortgaging all he has.\\nJust as he is about to put his plan into action, he receives a phone call from someone claiming to have kidnapped his son, Jun. Gondo is prepared to pay the ransom, but the call is dismissed as a prank when Jun comes in from playing outside. However, Jun\\'s playmate, Shinichi, the child of Gondo\\'s chauffeur, is missing and the kidnappers have mistakenly abducted him instead.\\nIn another phone call the kidnapper reveals that he has discovered his mistake but still demands the same ransom. Gondo is now forced to make a decision about whether to pay the ransom to save the child or complete the buyout. After a long night of contemplation Gondo announces that he will not pay the ransom, explaining that doing so would not only mean the loss of his position in the company, but cause him to go into debt and throw the futures of his wife and son into jeopardy. His plans are weakened when his top aide lets the \"cheap shoes\" faction know about the kidnapping in return for a promotion should they take over. Finally, after continuous pleading from the chauffeur and under pressure from his wife, Gondo decides to pay the ransom. Following the kidnapper\\'s instructions, the money is put into two small briefcases and thrown out from a moving train; Shinichi is found unharmed.\\nGondo is forced out of the company and his creditors demand the collateral in lieu of debt. The story is widely reported however, making Gondo a hero, while the National Shoe Company is vilified and boycotted. Meanwhile, the police eventually find the hideout where Shinichi was kept prisoner. The bodies of the kidnapper\\'s two accomplices are found there, killed by an overdose of heroin. The police surmise that the kidnapper engineered their deaths by supplying them with uncut drugs. Further clues lead to the identity of the kidnapper, a medical intern at a nearby hospital, but there is no hard evidence linking him to the accomplices\\' murders.\\nThe police lay a trap by first planting a false story in the newspapers implying that the accomplices are still alive, and then forging a note from them demanding more drugs. The kidnapper is then apprehended in the act of trying to supply another lethal dose of uncut heroin to his accomplices, after testing the strength on a drug addict who overdoses and dies. Most of the ransom money is recovered, but too late to save Gondo\\'s property from auction. With the kidnapper facing a death sentence, he requests to see Gondo while in prison and Gondo finally meets him face to face. Gondo has gone to work for a rival shoe company, earning less money but enjoying a free hand in running it. The kidnapper at first feigns no regrets for his actions. As he reveals that envy from seeing Gondo\\'s house on the hill every day led him to conceive of the crime, his emotions gradually gain control over him and he ends up breaking down emotionally before Gondo after finally facing his failure.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', \"Singin' in the Rain\": 'In 1927, popular silent film stars Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont attend the premiere of their latest film The Royal Rascal. Though Don can barely tolerate Lina, their studio, Monumental Pictures, links them romantically to increase publicity. Lina is convinced that they truly are in love, despite Don\\'s protestations otherwise. At a red-carpet interview, Don relates the story of his rise to stardom, though his words are contradicted by flashbacks showing his humble roots as a hoofer, Vaudeville musician and stuntman, alongside his best friend from boyhood Cosmo Brown (\"Fit as a Fiddle\").\\nAfter the premiere, Don escapes rabid fans by jumping into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden. Kathy, who claims to be a theater actress, drops him off, but not before deriding his accomplishments as a movie star.\\nLater, at an after-party, Monumental Pictures head R. F. Simpson, shows a short demonstration of the newfound talking picture. His guests are unimpressed, believing it will never amount to anything. To Don\\'s amusement, Kathy pops out of a mock cake, revealing herself to be a chorus girl (\"All I Do is Dream of You\"). Furious at Don\\'s teasing, she throws a cake at him, accidentally hitting Lina. Kathy runs away before Don can catch up with her.\\nWeeks later, Don is still smitten with Kathy and has been searching for her, with Cosmo trying to cheer him up (\"Make \\'Em Laugh\"). Lina reveals that she got Kathy fired. On the studio lot, Cosmo finds Kathy working as an extra in another Monumental Pictures production (\"Beautiful Girl\"). Kathy admits to actually being a fan of Don\\'s, while Don professes his feelings for her (\"You Were Meant for Me\").\\n\\nAfter rival studio Warner Bros. has an enormous hit with its first talking picture The Jazz Singer, R. F. decides he has no choice but to convert the next Lockwood and Lamont film, The Dueling Cavalier, into a talkie; Lina and Don undertake diction lessons in preparation (\"Moses Supposes\"). The production is beset with difficulties, including the actors being unfamiliar with the recording technology and Lina\\'s grating, high-pitched voice. Due to multiple complications (including awkward microphone placements, Don\\'s uninspired improvising and the audio going out of sync), The Dueling Cavalier\\'s preview screening is a failure.\\nAfterward, Kathy and Cosmo help Don come up with the idea to save The Dueling Cavalier by turning it into a musical (\"Good Morning\"). Cosmo, inspired by the film\\'s synchronization error, suggests they dub Lina\\'s voice with Kathy\\'s. Don drops Kathy off at her home and then walks home through a driving rain. (\"Singin\\' in the Rain\"). Don and Cosmo pitch the idea to R. F., changing the title of the film to The Dancing Cavalier and adding a modern framing device (\"Broadway Melody\"). R. F. approves but tells them not to inform Lina that Kathy is doing the dubbing.\\nHaving learned the truth, a furious Lina barges in on a dubbing session. She becomes even angrier after being told that Don and Kathy are in love and intend to marry, and that R. F. intends to give Kathy a screen credit and a big publicity buildup. Lina threatens to sue R. F. unless he makes sure no one ever hears of Kathy and that she keeps dubbing Lina for the rest of her career. R. F. reluctantly agrees because of a clause in Lina\\'s contract which holds the studio responsible for positive media coverage.\\nThe premiere of The Dancing Cavalier is a success (\"Would You\"). When the audience clamors for Lina to sing live, Don, Cosmo, and R. F. tell her to lip sync into a microphone while Kathy, concealed behind the curtain, sings into a second one. While Lina is \"singing\" (\"Singin\\' in the Rain Reprise\"), Don, Cosmo and R. F. open the curtain, revealing the ruse. The defeated Lina flees in humiliation. A distressed Kathy tries to run away as well, but Don proudly announces to the audience that she is \"the real star\" of the film (\"You Are My Lucky Star\"). Later, Kathy and Don kiss in front of a billboard for their new film Singin\\' in the Rain.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Requiem for a Dream': \"Sara Goldfarb, a widow who lives alone in a Brighton Beach apartment, spends her time watching television.

When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to appear on her favorite game show, she begins a restrictive crash diet in an attempt to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation.\\nAt the advice of her friend Rae, Sara visits a physician who prescribes her amphetamines to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs of her drug abuse and implores her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends Ada and Rae are her remaining reasons to live. As time passes Sara becomes frantic waiting for the invitation and increases her dosage, which causes her to develop amphetamine psychosis.\\nTyrone is caught in a shootout between drug traffickers and the Sicilian Mafia and is arrested despite his innocence. Harry has to use most of their saved money to post bail. As a result of the gang warfare, the local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any to buy. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming to New York from Florida, but the price has doubled and the minimum purchase risk is high. Harry encourages Marion to engage in sex work, particularly with her psychiatrist, Arnold, as a client. This request, along with their mounting withdrawal symptoms, strains their relationship.\\nSara's increased dosage of amphetamines distorts her sense of reality, and she begins to hallucinate that she is mocked by the host and crowd from the television show, and attacked by her refrigerator. Sara flees her apartment and goes to the casting agency office in Manhattan to confirm when she will be on television. Sara's disturbed state causes her to be admitted to a psychiatric ward, where she fails to respond to various medications. She undergoes electroconvulsive therapy instead. After the heroin shipment descends into a melee, Harry and Tyrone travel to Miami to buy heroin directly from the wholesaler. However, Harry's arm has become gangrenous from heroin use, so the two stop at a hospital. The doctor realizes that Harry is a drug addict and calls the police, resulting in Harry and Tyrone being arrested.\\nBack in New York City, a desperate Marion begins to work for a pimp, Big Tim, and participates in group sex for drugs. Sara's treatment leaves her in a dissociated catatonic near-vegetative state, to the horror of her friends Ada and Rae, who weep and try to comfort each other on a bench outside the hospital. Harry's arm is amputated above the elbow, and he breaks down in tears after he realizes Marion will not visit him. Tyrone is subjected to grueling labor and psychological abuse from the racist prison guards, all while experiencing a painful heroin withdrawal. Marion returns home and lies on her sofa, clutching her score of heroin and surrounded by her crumpled and discarded clothing designs. Each of the four characters curls into a fetal position. Sara imagines herself as the beautiful game show winner, with Harry—married and successful—arriving as a guest. Sara and Harry lovingly embrace.\\n\\n\\n== Cast\", 'Capernaum': 'Zain El Hajj, a 12-year-old from the slums of Beirut, is serving a five-year prison sentence in Roumieh Prison for stabbing someone whom he refers to as a \"son of a bitch\". Neither Zain nor his parents know his exact date of birth as they never applied/received an official birth certificate. Zain is brought before a court, having decided to take civil action against his parents, his mother, Souad, and his father, Selim. When asked by the judge why he wants to sue his parents, Zain answers \"Because I was born\" (or, more precisely, \"because you had me\"). Meanwhile, Lebanese authorities process a group of migrant workers, including a young Ethiopian woman named Rahil.\\nThe story then flashes back several months to before Zain was arrested. Zain lives with his parents and takes care of at least seven younger siblings who make money in various schemes instead of going to school. He uses forged prescriptions to purchase tramadol pills from multiple pharmacies, which they crush into powder and soak them into clothes, which his brother sells to drug addicts in prison. Zain also works as a delivery boy for Assad, the family\\'s landlord, and the owner of a local market stall. One morning, Zain helps his 11-year-old sister Sahar to hide the evidence of her first period, fearing she will be married to Assad if her parents discover that she can now become pregnant.\\nZain makes plans to escape with Sahar and begin a new life. However, his suspicions are proven correct as her parents marry off Sahar to Assad in exchange for two chickens. Furious at his parents, Zain runs away and catches a bus, where he meets an elderly man dressed in a knock-off Spider-Man costume who calls himself \"Cockroach Man\". Cockroach Man gets off the bus at the Luna Park in Ras Beirut and Zain follows him, spending the rest of the day at the park. While on the ferris wheel, Zain sees a beautiful sunset and begins to cry. Later, Zain meets Rahil, an Ethiopian migrant worker who is working as a cleaner at the park. She takes pity on Zain and agrees to let him live with her at her tin shack in exchange for Zain babysitting her undocumented infant son Yonas when she is at work.\\nRahil\\'s forged migrant documents are due to expire soon and she does not have enough money to pay her forger Aspro for new documents. Aspro offers to forge the documents for free if she gives Yonas to him so that Yonas can be adopted. Rahil refuses, despite Aspro\\'s claims that Yonas\\' undocumented status will mean he can never receive an education or be employed. Rahil\\'s documents expire and she is arrested by Lebanese authorities. After she does not return to the shack, Zain panics. Several days pass, and Zain begins looking after Yonas on his own, claiming that they are brothers, and begins selling tramadol again to earn money.\\nOne day, while at Souk Al Ahad, where Aspro is based, Zain meets a young girl named Maysoun. Maysoun is a Syrian refugee and claims that Aspro has agreed to send her to Sweden. Zain demands that Aspro send him to Sweden as well, which Aspro agrees to do if Zain gives him Yonas. Zain reluctantly agrees, and Aspro tells him that he will need some form of identification to become a refugee. Zain returns to his parents and demands they give him his identification, to which they laughingly tell him he doesn\\'t have any. Having disowned him for leaving, they kick him out of their house, but not before revealing that Sahar had recently died due to difficulties with her pregnancy. Furious, Zain takes a large knife, runs out the house and stabs Assad. Zain is arrested and sentenced to five years at Roumieh Prison.\\nWhile in prison, during a visit from his mother, Zain learns that Souad is pregnant yet again and plans to name the child Sahar. Disgusted by his mother\\'s lack of remorse for her daughter\\'s death, he tells her not to visit again, calling her \"heartless\". During a TV show requesting call-in commentary on child abuse, Zain contacts the media and says that he is tired of parents neglecting their children and plans to sue his parents for continuing to have children when they cannot take care of them. When the judge asks him what he wants from his parents, he says \"I want them to stop having children\", as he does not want them to suffer the neglect he has. Zain also alleges that Aspro is adopting children illegally and mistreating them. Aspro\\'s house is raided and the children and parents are reunited, including Yonas and Rahil.\\nZain\\'s photo is taken for his ID card. The photographer cracks a joke at Zain\\'s sour disposition—\"It\\'s your ID card, not your death certificate\"—and Zain manages a smile.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Toy Story 3': 'Andy, now 17 years old, is preparing to leave for college.

As the despondent toys reflect on their future, the soldiers parachute out the window and leave. Andy intends to take Woody to college, and puts the other toys into a trash bag, to be placed in the attic; however, Andy\\'s mother mistakenly puts the bag outside with the true garbage. The toys narrowly escape from the garbage truck, and, believing Andy deliberately threw them away, get into a donation box in Andy\\'s mother\\'s car with Molly\\'s old Barbie doll. Woody follows in an attempt to bring them back, but is unable to convince the others of Andy\\'s real intentions, and goes along when Andy\\'s mother takes the box of donations to Sunnyside Daycare.\\nAt Sunnyside, Andy\\'s toys are welcomed by the other toys, led by Lots-O\\'-Huggin\\' Bear (\"Lotso\").

Woody attempts to return home, but is instead found by a child from Sunnyside named Bonnie, who brings him home and plays with him and her other toys. Bonnie\\'s toys are shocked that Woody escaped from Sunnyside. Chuckles, a toy clown, explains that he, Lotso, and Big Baby, Lotso\\'s assistant at Sunnyside, were owned by a girl named Daisy, but were lost during a family trip. When they made it home, Lotso found out that he had been replaced. Disregarding Chuckles\\' protests, the embittered Lotso lied to Big Baby that Daisy had replaced all of them.

The rest of Andy\\'s toys jump after him as the truck arrives, and all fall inside.\\nBuzz returns to normal after a television falls onto him inside the truck. The truck takes the toys to a landfill, where they are swept onto a conveyor belt leading to an incinerator. The Aliens spot an industrial claw, but are swept away while running toward it. After narrowly avoiding a shredder and rescuing Lotso, Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them. The toys fall into the incinerator and resign themselves to their apparent fate, but the Aliens rescue them with the industrial claw. Lotso is later found by a garbage truck driver, who fastens him to his truck\\'s radiator grille as a decoration. Woody and his friends ride Sid\\'s garbage truck back to Andy\\'s house.\\nWoody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, donates the toys to Bonnie.

Luke soon arrives to bargain for his friends' release, but Jabba drops him through a trapdoor to be eaten by a rancor. After Luke kills it, Jabba sentences him, Han, and Chewbacca to death by being fed to the sarlacc, a deadly beast entombed in the desert floor. Having hidden his new green lightsaber inside R2-D2, Luke frees himself and his friends. The group battle Jabba's men aboard his sail barge. During the chaos, Boba Fett falls into the sarlacc after Han inadvertently damages his jet pack. Meanwhile, Leia strangles Jabba to death with her chains. After destroying Jabba's sail barge, the group escapes.\\nAs the others rendezvous with the Rebel Alliance, Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with Yoda, whom he discovers is dying. Yoda confirms that Darth Vader is Luke's father, the former Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and reveals that there is another Skywalker, before passing away and becoming one with the Force. Obi-Wan Kenobi's Force spirit tells Luke the truth about Anakin's fall to the dark side, that Leia is his twin sister, and that he must face Vader again to finish his training and defeat the Empire.\\nThe Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a second Death Star under the supervision of the Emperor. The station is protected by an energy shield on the forest moon of Endor. To destroy its generator, Han leads a strike team which includes Luke, Leia and Chewbacca. Using a stolen Imperial shuttle to arrive undetected, the team encounters a tribe of Ewoks, gaining their trust after an initial conflict. Later, Luke tells Leia that she is his sister and Vader is their father. Surrendering to Imperial troops, he is brought before Vader, and fails to convince him to reject the dark side of the Force.\\nLuke is brought to the Emperor, who intends to turn him to the dark side, and reveals that his friends and the Rebel fleet are headed into a trap. On Endor, Han's team is captured by Imperial forces, but a counterattack by the Ewoks allows the Rebels to infiltrate the shield generator. Meanwhile, Lando Calrissian and Admiral Ackbar lead the Rebel assault on the Death Star, finding its shield still active and the Imperial fleet waiting for them.\\nThe Emperor reveals to Luke that the Death Star is fully operational and orders the firing of its superlaser, destroying a Rebel starship. He tempts Luke to give in to his anger. Luke attempts to attack him, but Vader intervenes and the two engage in a lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister and threatens to turn her to the dark side if Luke does not. In retaliation, Luke defeats Vader, severing his prosthetic hand. The Emperor betrays Vader by ordering Luke to take Vader's place, but Luke refuses, declaring himself to be a Jedi, like his father before him. Enraged, the Emperor starts torturing Luke with Force lightning. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader betrays the Emperor by throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death, but he is fatally electrocuted in the process. Vader's final request is that Luke remove his mask so he can see his son with his own eyes, which he does. Redeemed, Anakin Skywalker dies.\\nAfter the strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads Rebel fighters into the Death Star's core. While the Rebel fleet destroys the Imperial command ship, Lando and X-wing fighter pilot Wedge Antilles destroy the Death Star's main reactor and escape before the station explodes.

One employee, Patrick, leaves to see Clementine. Since her procedure, he has been using Joel's and Clementine's memories as a guide for seducing her. While the procedure runs on Joel's brain, the technician, Stan, and the secretary, Mary, take drugs, party and have sex.\\nJoel re-experiences his memories of Clementine as they are erased, starting with their last fight. As he reaches earlier, happier memories, he realizes that he does not want to forget her. His mental projection of Clementine suggests that Joel hide her in memories that do not involve her. This halts the procedure, but Stan calls his boss, Howard, who arrives and restarts it. Joel comes to his last remaining memory of Clementine: the day they first met, on a beach in Montauk. As the memory crumbles around them, Clementine tells Joel to meet her in Montauk.\\nIn Joel's apartment, while Stan is outside, Mary tells Howard she is in love with him and they kiss.

The next day, they find an alien monolith has appeared in their midst. The tribe then learns how to use a bone as a weapon and after their first hunt, return to drive their rivals away with it.\\nMillions of years later, Dr. Heywood Floyd, Chairman of the United States National Council of Astronautics, travels to Clavius Base, an American lunar outpost. During a stopover at Space Station 5, he meets Russian scientists who are concerned that Clavius seems to be unresponsive. He refuses to discuss rumours of an epidemic at the base. At Clavius, Heywood addresses a meeting of personnel to whom he stresses the need for secrecy regarding their newest discovery. His mission is to investigate a recently found artefact, a monolith buried four million years earlier near the lunar crater Tycho. As he and others examine the object and are taking photographs, it emits a high-powered radio signal.\\nEighteen months later, the American spacecraft Discovery One is bound for Jupiter, with mission pilots and scientists Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole on board, along with three other scientists in suspended animation. Most of Discovery's operations are controlled by HAL, a HAL 9000 computer with a human-like personality. When HAL reports the imminent failure of an antenna control device, Dave retrieves it in an extravehicular activity (EVA) pod, but finds nothing wrong. HAL suggests reinstalling the device and letting it fail so the problem can be verified. Mission Control advises the astronauts that results from their backup 9000 computer indicate that HAL has made an error, but HAL blames it on human error. Concerned about HAL's behaviour, Dave and Frank enter an EVA pod so they can talk in private without HAL overhearing. They agree to disconnect HAL if he is proven wrong. HAL follows their conversation by lip reading.\\nWhile Frank is outside the ship to replace the antenna unit, HAL takes control of his pod, setting him adrift. Dave takes another pod to rescue Frank. While he is outside, HAL turns off the life support functions of the crewmen in suspended animation, killing them. When Dave returns to the ship with Frank's corpse, HAL refuses to let him back in, stating that their plan to deactivate him jeopardises the mission. Dave releases Frank's body and opens one of the ship's airlocks with his remote manipulators. Lacking a helmet for his spacesuit, he positions his pod carefully so that when he opens the pod's airlock, he is propelled by the escaping air across the vacuum into Discovery's airlock. He enters HAL's processor core and begins disconnecting most of HAL's circuits, ignoring HAL's pleas to stop. When he is finished, a prerecorded video by Heywood plays, revealing that the mission's actual objective is to investigate the radio signal sent from the monolith to Jupiter.\\nAt Jupiter, Dave finds a third, much larger monolith orbiting the planet. He leaves Discovery in an EVA pod to investigate. He is pulled into a vortex of coloured light and observes bizarre astronomical phenomena and strange landscapes of unusual colours as he passes by. Finally he finds himself in a large neoclassical bedroom where he sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself: first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in bed. A monolith appears at the foot of the bed, and as Dave reaches for it, he is transformed into a foetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light floating in space above the Earth.\\n\\n\\n== Cast\", 'The Hunt': 'In a group chat, Athena Stone, Ted, Richard, Miranda, Julius, Peter, Martin, Mike and Liberty, discuss an upcoming hunt of \"deplorables\" at a manor.\\nLater, on Athena\\'s private jet, a flight attendant talks to Richard but is interrupted by Randy, who staggers out from the cargo hold.

White flees with Orange, who was shot during the escape and is bleeding severely in the back of White\\'s car. At one of Joe\\'s warehouses, White and Orange rendezvous with Pink, who believes that the job was a setup and that the police were waiting for them. White informs him that Brown is dead, Blue and Blonde are missing, and Blonde murdered several civilians during the heist. White is furious that Joe, his old friend, would employ Blonde, whom he describes as a psychopath. Pink has hidden the diamonds nearby and argues with White over whether to get medical attention for Orange, and the pair draw guns at each other. They stand down when Blonde arrives with a kidnapped policeman, Marvin Nash.\\nSome time earlier, Blonde meets with the Cabots, having completed a four-year jail sentence. To reward him for not having given Joe\\'s name to the authorities in exchange for a lighter sentence, they offer him a no-show job. Blonde is grateful, but insists that he wants to get back to \"real work\", and they recruit him for the heist.\\nIn the present, White and Pink beat Nash for information.

Orange reveals to Nash that he is an undercover police officer, and that the police will appear when Joe comes to the warehouse.\\nWhen Eddie, Pink, and White return, Orange tries to convince them that Blonde planned to kill them all and steal the diamonds for himself. Eddie shoots and kills Nash, then accuses Orange of lying, since Blonde was loyal to his father. Joe arrives with news that the police have killed Blue.

His wife is dead, and his son, Mitsuo, and daughter-in-law, who live with him, seem to care mainly about Watanabe\\'s pension and their future inheritance. At work, he\\'s a party to constant bureaucratic inaction. In one case, a group of parents seemingly endlessly are referred to one department after another when they want a cesspool cleared and replaced by a playground. After learning he has stomach cancer and less than a year to live, Watanabe attempts to come to terms with his impending death. He plans to tell his son about the cancer, but decides against it when his son does not pay attention to him. He then tries to find escape in the pleasures of Tokyo\\'s nightlife, guided by an eccentric novelist whom he has just met. In a nightclub, Watanabe requests a song from the piano player, and sings \"Gondola no Uta\" with great sadness. His singing greatly affects those watching him. After one night submerged in the nightlife, he realizes this is not the solution.\\nThe following day, Watanabe encounters Toyo, a young female subordinate, who needs his signature on her resignation. He takes comfort in observing her joyous love of life and enthusiasm, and he tries to spend as much time as possible with her. She eventually becomes suspicious of his intentions and grows wary of him. After persuading her to join him for the last time, he becomes open and asks for the secret to her love of life. She says that she does not know but that she found happiness in her new job making toys, which makes her feel as if she is playing with all the children of Japan.

Like Toyo, he wants to make something, but he is unsure what he can do within the city bureaucracy until he remembers the lobbying for a playground. He surprises everyone by returning to work after a long absence, and he begins pushing for a playground despite concerns that he is intruding on the jurisdiction of other departments.\\nWatanabe dies, and at his wake, his former co-workers gather, after the opening of the playground, to figure out what caused such a dramatic change in his behavior. His transformation from listless bureaucrat to passionate advocate puzzles them.

E. Lawrence dies in a motorcycle accident. His memorial service is held at St Paul\\'s Cathedral.\\nDuring the First World War, Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant, notable for his insolence and education. Over the objections of General Murray, Mr. Dryden of the Arab Bureau sends him to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal in his revolt against the Turks. On the journey, his Bedouin guide Tafas is killed by Sherif Ali ibn el Kharish for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton\\'s orders when he meets Faisal; his outspokenness piques the prince\\'s interest.\\nBrighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence conceives a surprise attack on Aqaba, whose capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. To do this, he convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a pessimistic Sherif Ali. The teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. With difficulties, they cross the Nefud Desert and travel without rest on the last stage to reach water. An Arab named Gasim succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers Gasim missing, he turns back and rescues him. Won over, the men accept Lawrence as one of their own.\\nLawrence persuades Auda Abu Tayi, the leader of the local Howeitat tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence\\'s scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali\\'s men kills one of Auda\\'s men because of a blood feud. Since retaliation by the Howeitat would shatter the alliance, Lawrence announces he will execute the murderer himself. Lawrence is stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim but shoots him anyway.\\nThe next morning, the Arabs overrun the Turkish garrison. Lawrence heads to Cairo with Daud and Farraj to inform Dryden and the new commander, General Allenby, of his victory. While crossing the Sinai Desert, Daud dies after stumbling into quicksand. Although Lawrence\\'s report of Aqaba\\'s capture is initially disbelieved, he is promoted to major and given arms and money for the Arabs. Lawrence asks Allenby whether there is any basis for the Arabs\\' suspicions that the British have designs on Arabia. Allenby states that there is none.\\n\\n\\n=== Part II ===\\nLawrence launches a guerrilla war by blowing up the Ottoman railway between Damascus and Medina and harassing the Turks. An American war correspondent, Jackson Bentley, publicises Lawrence\\'s exploits and makes him famous. On one raid, Farraj is badly injured.

Lawrence is stripped, ogled, and prodded. For striking out at the Bey, Lawrence is flogged and thrown into the street, where Ali comes to his aid. The experience leaves Lawrence shaken. He returns to British headquarters in Cairo but does not fit in.\\nIn Jerusalem, General Allenby urges him to support the \"big push\" on Damascus. Lawrence reluctantly returns.\\nHe recruits an army that is motivated more by money than by the Arab cause.

Holding a snow globe, he utters his last word, \"Rosebud\", and dies. A newsreel obituary tells the life story of Kane, an enormously wealthy newspaper publisher and industrial magnate. Kane\\'s death becomes sensational news around the world, and the newsreel\\'s producer tasks reporter Jerry Thompson with discovering the meaning of \"Rosebud\".\\nThompson sets out to interview Kane\\'s friends and associates. He tries to approach his second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, now an alcoholic who runs her own nightclub, but she refuses to talk to him. Thompson goes to the private archive of the late banker Walter Parks Thatcher. Through Thatcher\\'s written memoirs, Thompson learns about Kane\\'s rise from a Colorado boarding house and the decline of his fortune.\\nIn 1871, gold was discovered through a mining deed belonging to Kane\\'s mother, Mary Kane. She hired Thatcher to establish a trust that would provide for Kane\\'s education and assume guardianship of him. While the parents and Thatcher discussed arrangements inside the boarding house, the young Kane played happily with a sled in the snow outside. When Kane\\'s parents introduced him to Thatcher, the boy struck Thatcher with his sled and attempted to run away.\\nBy the time Kane gained control of his trust at the age of 25, the mine\\'s productivity and Thatcher\\'s prudent investing had made Kane one of the richest men in the world. Kane took control of the New York Inquirer newspaper and embarked on a career of yellow journalism, publishing scandalous articles that attacked Thatcher\\'s (and his own) business interests. Kane sold his newspaper empire to Thatcher after the 1929 stock market crash left Kane short of cash.\\nThompson interviews Kane\\'s personal business manager, Mr. Bernstein. Bernstein recalls that Kane hired the best journalists available to build the Inquirer\\'s circulation. Kane rose to power by successfully manipulating public opinion regarding the Spanish–American War and marrying Emily Norton, the niece of the President of the United States.\\nThompson interviews Kane\\'s estranged best friend, Jedediah Leland, in a retirement home. Leland says that Kane\\'s marriage to Emily disintegrated over the years, and he began an affair with amateur singer Susan Alexander while running for Governor of New York. Both his wife and his political opponent discovered the affair, and the public scandal ended his political career. Kane married Susan and forced her into a humiliating operatic career for which she had neither the talent nor the ambition, even building a large opera house for her. After Leland began to write a negative review of Susan\\'s disastrous opera debut, Kane fired him but finished the negative review and printed it. Susan protested that she never wanted the opera career anyway, but Kane forced her to continue the season.\\nSusan consents to an interview with Thompson and describes the aftermath of her opera career. She attempted suicide, and so Kane finally allowed her to abandon singing. After many unhappy years and after being hit by Kane, she finally decided to leave him. Kane\\'s butler Raymond recounts that, after Susan left him, he began violently destroying the contents of her bedroom. When he happened upon a snow globe, he grew calm and said \"Rosebud\". Thompson concludes that he cannot solve the mystery and that the meaning of Kane\\'s last word will remain a mystery.\\nBack at Xanadu, Kane\\'s belongings are cataloged or discarded by the staff. They find the sled on which eight-year-old Kane was playing on the day that he was taken from his home in Colorado and throw it into a furnace with other items. Behind their backs, the sled slowly burns and its trade name, printed on top, becomes visible through the flames: \"Rosebud\".\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'North by Northwest': 'In 1958 New York City, a waiter pages \"George Kaplan\" at the Plaza Hotel\\'s Oak Room restaurant after a pair of thugs presumably requests him to do so.

He is interrogated by spy Phillip Vandamm, a Cold War enemy of the United States, posing as Townsend. Vandamm arranges Thornhill\\'s death in a staged drunk-driving crash. Thornhill survives, but fails to convince his mother and the police about the happenings. Revisiting the estate, Thornhill learns Townsend is a United Nations diplomat.\\nThornhill and his mother go to Kaplan\\'s empty hotel room at the Plaza, where the thugs have followed him and begin their pursuit. Thornhill heads to the U.N. General Assembly Building to meet Townsend, who, he discovers, is not Vandamm. One of the pursuing thugs throws a knife, killing Townsend, who collapses in Thornhill\\'s arms. Thornhill is photographed as he grabs the knife, giving the appearance that he is the murderer; he then flees, attempting to find the real Kaplan. An unnamed government intelligence agency realizes that Thornhill has been mistaken for Kaplan, but decides against rescuing him for fear of compromising their operation: Kaplan is a non-existent agent they created to confuse and distract Vandamm.\\nThornhill boards the 20th Century Limited train to Chicago, where he meets Eve Kendall, who hides him from the police. The two establish a relationship—on Kendall\\'s part because she is secretly working with Vandamm—and she tells Thornhill that she has arranged a meeting with Kaplan at an isolated rural bus stop. Thornhill waits there, but is attacked by a crop duster plane. After taking cover in a cornfield, he attempts to halt a tank truck; it brakes, the airplane crashes into it, and he escapes during the aftermath of the explosion. Thornhill reaches Kaplan\\'s hotel in Chicago and learns that Kaplan had checked out before the time when Kendall claimed she talked to him. Thornhill goes to her room and confronts her, but she leaves. He tracks her to an art auction, where he finds Vandamm purchasing a Mexican Purépecha statue.\\n\\nVandamm leaves his thugs to deal with Thornhill. To escape, Thornhill disrupts the auction until police are called to remove him. He says he is the fugitive murderer, but the government agency\\'s chief, \"The Professor\", intervenes and reveals that Kaplan was invented to distract Vandamm from the real government agent: Eve Kendall. Thornhill agrees to help maintain her cover. At the Mount Rushmore visitor center near Rapid City, South Dakota, Thornhill—now willingly playing the role of Kaplan—negotiates Vandamm\\'s turnover of Kendall to be arrested. Kendall then shoots Thornhill, seemingly fatally, and flees. The bullets were blanks to fool Vandamm as to Kaplan\\'s demise. Afterward, the Professor arranges for Thornhill and Kendall to meet. Thornhill learns Kendall must depart on a plane with Vandamm and his henchman Leonard. He tries to dissuade her from going, but is knocked unconscious, at the Professor\\'s behest, and locked in a hospital room.\\nThornhill escapes the Professor\\'s custody and goes to Vandamm\\'s house to rescue Kendall. At the house, Thornhill overhears that the sculpture holds microfilm and that Leonard has discovered the blanks remaining in Kendall\\'s gun. Vandamm indicates that he will kill Kendall by throwing her from the plane. Thornhill manages to warn her with a surreptitious note. Vandamm, Leonard, and Kendall head for the plane. Thornhill is momentarily held at gunpoint until he realizes the gun is the one with blanks. As Vandamm boards, Kendall takes the sculpture and runs to the pursuing Thornhill. They flee to the top of Mount Rushmore. As they climb down the mountain, they are pursued by Vandamm\\'s thugs, including Leonard, who is fatally shot by a park ranger. Vandamm is taken into custody by the Professor.\\nMeanwhile, Kendall is hanging on to the mountain by her fingertips.

She agrees, but first meets up with a \"former fling\", who turns out to be Sheldrake. When Sheldrake dissuades her from breaking up with him, promising to divorce his wife, they head to Baxter\\'s apartment, while Baxter waits outside the theater.\\nDuring the company\\'s raucous Christmas party, Sheldrake\\'s secretary, Miss Olsen, tells Fran that her boss has had affairs with other female employees, including herself. Fran confronts Sheldrake at Baxter\\'s apartment, but he claims he loves her, then heads back to his suburban family.\\nRealizing that Fran is the woman Sheldrake has been taking to his apartment, Baxter lets himself be picked up by a married lady at a local bar. When they arrive at his apartment, he discovers Fran, passed out on his bed from an apparent suicidal overdose of sleeping pills. He ditches the woman from the bar and enlists Dr. Dreyfuss, a medical doctor living in the next-door apartment, to revive Fran. When Baxter makes Dreyfuss believe that he was the cause of the incident, Dreyfuss scolds him for philandering and advises him to \"be a mensch.\"\\nThe next day, Mrs. Dreyfuss brings breakfast over for Fran and pleads with her to make a lifestyle change and settle down. Mrs. Dreyfuss and Fran repeatedly point out the poor housekeeping in Baxter\\'s bachelor pad, notably including the fact that he uses a tennis racket as spaghetti strainer in the kitchen. Dr. Dreyfuss recommends that Fran spend two days recuperating in the apartment, during which time she grows close to Baxter, especially after he confesses to his own suicide attempt over unrequited feelings for a woman who now sends him a fruitcake every Christmas. Fran says she has always suffered bad luck in her love life.\\nAs Baxter prepares a romantic dinner, one of the managers arrives for a tryst. Baxter persuades him and his companion to leave, but the manager recognizes Fran and informs his colleagues. Later confronted by Fran\\'s brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka, who is looking for her, the jealous managers direct Karl to Baxter\\'s apartment. Baxter and Fran are in the middle of eating meatballs and spaghetti, which Baxter strained using the tennis racket, when Karl rings the doorbell and demands that Fran return home to her sister who is concerned about her. Baxter deflects the brother\\'s-in-law anger over Fran\\'s wayward behavior by once again assuming all responsibility. When Karl finds out about Fran\\'s suicide attempt, he punches Baxter twice, knocking him to the floor. Fran reacts by kissing Baxter on the forehead for protecting her, exclaiming softly \"Oh you fool, you damn fool.\"\\nWhen Sheldrake learns that Miss Olsen tipped off Fran about his affairs, he fires her, but she retaliates by spilling all to Sheldrake\\'s wife, who promptly throws her husband out. With no regrets for his behavior, Sheldrake believes that this situation just makes it easier to pursue Fran, although she hints that she is losing interest. Having promoted Baxter to an even higher position, which also gives him a key to the executive washroom, Sheldrake expects Baxter to loan out his apartment yet again for him and Fran. Baxter gives him back the washroom key instead, proclaiming that he has decided to become a mensch, and quits the firm, forbidding Sheldrake from ever bringing anyone to his apartment again, and \"especially not Ms. Kubelik\". He decides to move out of the apartment and begins to pack his belongings, including a handgun and the tennis racket.\\nThat night at a New Year\\'s Eve party, Sheldrake indignantly tells Fran about Baxter quitting rather than let Sheldrake bring Ms. Kubelik to his apartment. Realizing her love for Baxter, Fran abandons Sheldrake and runs to the apartment. At the door, she hears an apparent gunshot. Fearing that Baxter has shot himself, she frantically pounds on the door. Baxter opens the door with a bottle of champagne in his hand, having just popped the cork. As they sit down to a game of cards, Fran reveals that she is on her own, like he is. When he asks about Sheldrake, she replies, \"We\\'ll send him a fruitcake every Christmas,” prompting him to declare his love for her. She hands him the cards and affectionately tells him to \"Shut up and deal\".\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Double Indemnity': 'Late one night in 1938, insurance salesman Walter Neff returns to his downtown Los Angeles office in pain from a gunshot wound. He begins dictating a confession into a dictaphone for his friend and boss, claims adjuster Barton Keyes. The story, told primarily in flashback, ensues.\\nA year before, Neff meets the alluring Phyllis Dietrichson during a house call to remind her husband to renew his automobile insurance policy. They flirt, until Phyllis asks about taking out a policy on her husband\\'s life without his knowledge. Neff deduces she is contemplating murder, and initially wants no part of it, but eventually devises a plan to murder her husband and trigger the \"double indemnity\" clause, which would double the payout.\\nPhyllis drives her husband to the train station for a trip to attend a college reunion. Neff, hiding in the back seat, breaks his neck. Neff then boards the train posing as Dietrichson and makes his way to the back of the train, stepping onto the platform outside to smoke a cigarette. He jumps off at a prearranged spot to meet Phyllis and drag Dietrichson\\'s body onto the tracks.\\nNorton, the company president, believes the death was suicide, but Keyes scoffs at the idea. Keyes suspects foul play on Phyllis\\' part because he thinks she was having an affair. Norton refuses to pay out the accidental death clause, deducing that Dietrichson was unaware of the policy. Keyes tells Neff his theory while Phyllis is hiding behind the door, concluding that Phyllis and an accomplice murdered Dietrichson for the insurance money, but he needs proof.\\nThe victim\\'s daughter, Lola, tells Neff she is convinced that her stepmother Phyllis is not only behind her father\\'s death, but also that of Lola\\'s mother, who died under suspicious circumstances when Phyllis was her nurse. Neff begins seeing Lola to keep her from taking her suspicions the police. Later Neff fears Phyllis will murder Lola for her suspicions and because Dietrichson had changed his will in Lola\\'s favour, leaving Phyllis with nothing.\\nKeyes brings in a witness who says the man on the train was younger than the dead man. Neff warns Phyllis that pursuing the insurance claim in court risks exposing the murder. He points out that Norton and Keyes are suspicious of her. He tries to convince Phyllis to lie low while he persuades Norton to pay out the claim. Lola tells Neff she has discovered that her hotheaded boyfriend Nino has been visiting Phyllis behind their backs. Neff sees this as a way to get rid of Phyllis before she can murder Lola.\\nNeff meets Phyllis and says he knows about her and Nino. He guesses that she was planning to manipulate Nino into murdering Lola and maybe him, but says he will kill her and put the blame on Nino. Phyllis shoots him in the shoulder. He dares her to shoot again. She does not, and he takes the gun. She says she never loved him \"until a minute ago, when I couldn\\'t fire that second shot.\" As she hugs him, Neff says \"Goodbye, baby,\" and shoots twice, killing her.\\nOutside, Nino comes to the house; Neff advises him to call Lola from the drugstore\\'s phone instead of going inside the house. Neff drives to his office and starts his dictaphone confession, returning to the start of the film. Keyes arrives unnoticed and hears the truth. Neff says he plans to flee to Mexico, but collapses before he can leave the building. Keyes lights Neff\\'s cigarette as they wait for the police and an ambulance.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Scarface': 'In 1980, Cuban refugee and ex-convict Tony Montana arrives in Miami as part of the Mariel boatlift, where he is sent to a refugee camp with his best friend Manny Ray and their companions Angel and Chi-Chi. The four are released and given green cards in exchange for murdering a former Cuban general at the request of Miami drug lord Frank Lopez. They find work as dishwashers at a restaurant, but are dissatisfied. Tony proclaims that he is meant for bigger things. Frank\\'s right-hand man Omar Suarez sends the four to purchase cocaine from Colombian dealers. Tony and Angel are captured at gunpoint, and Tony is forced to watch Angel being dismembered with a chainsaw before Manny and Chi-Chi rescue him. The three kill the Colombians and personally deliver the recovered drugs and money to Frank, suspecting that Omar set them up.\\nDuring their meeting, Tony becomes attracted to Frank\\'s trophy wife, Elvira. Tony and Manny begin working for Frank. Later, Tony visits his mother and younger sister Gina, the latter of whom he is overprotective. Disgusted by his life of crime, Tony\\'s mother throws him out. Manny is attracted to Gina, but Tony tells him to stay away from her. Frank sends Tony and Omar to Cochabamba, Bolivia, to meet with cocaine kingpin Alejandro Sosa. During the meeting, Omar is unhappy when Tony negotiates a large deal without Frank\\'s approval. Sosa later has his men hang Omar from a helicopter, telling Tony that he was a police informant and that Frank has poor judgment for having trusted him. Tony vouches for Frank\\'s organization; Sosa takes a liking to Tony and agrees to the deal, but warns Tony to never double cross him.\\nSeeing that Frank is infuriated by Omar\\'s death and the size of the deal with Sosa, Tony sets up an independent cocaine operation. Mel Bernstein, a corrupt police detective on Frank\\'s payroll, accosts Tony at a nightclub and attempts to extort money from him in return for police protection. Tony spots Gina fraternizing with a man and confronts them both when he sees him grope her. Hitmen then attempt to kill Tony, who escapes with a bullet wound. He confronts Frank and Bernstein, certain that they orchestrated the attack; Frank confesses his involvement at gunpoint and begs for his life, but Tony has Manny shoot him dead before proceeding to kill Bernstein. Tony marries Elvira and becomes the distributor of Sosa\\'s product using his profits to build a multi-million-dollar business empire and construct a large, heavily-guarded estate.\\nIn 1983, a money laundering sting operation by federal agents results in Tony being charged with tax evasion and facing a prison sentence. Sosa offers to use his government connections to keep Tony out of prison, but only if Tony helps kill an activist intending to expose Sosa\\'s drug operations. During dinner at an upscale restaurant, Tony accuses Manny of causing his arrest and Elvira of being an infertile junkie, prompting Elvira to leave him. Tony and Sosa\\'s henchman \"Shadow\" travel to New York City to assassinate the activist. Shadow plants a radio-controlled bomb under the activist\\'s car, but Tony tries to call off the hit upon seeing him accompanied by his wife and children. When Shadow refuses to back down, Tony kills him before he can detonate the bomb. Tony returns to Miami, where an enraged Sosa calls him to promise retribution for allowing the activist to deliver the exposé. \\nAt his mother\\'s behest, Tony, who is high on cocaine, tracks down Gina and finds her with Manny. In a fit of rage, Tony shoots Manny dead only to learn that Gina had just married him. A distraught Tony returns to his estate with Gina and begins a massive cocaine binge in his office. Sosa\\'s men begin to invade the grounds and kill Tony\\'s guards as Gina enters the office with a gun, accusing him of wanting her for himself. She shoots and wounds him, but is killed by one of Sosa\\'s men whom Tony kills in return. Tony takes a rifle against the invaders, killing many of them but suffering multiple gunshot wounds. He taunts his attackers until an assassin climbs up to the office and shoots him in the back. Tony\\'s body falls off the balcony into a pool, where it floats near the base of a globe bearing the ironic motto \"The World Is Yours\".\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Full Metal Jacket': 'During the Vietnam War, a group of recruits arrive at the United States Marine Corps training facility at Parris Island. Drill instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman uses harsh methods to train them for combat. Among the recruits is the overweight and dim-witted Leonard Lawrence, whom Hartman nicknames \"Gomer Pyle\", and the wisecracking J.T. Davis, who receives the name \"Joker\" after interrupting Hartman\\'s introductory speech with an impression of John Wayne.\\nDuring basic training, Hartman names Joker as squad leader and puts him in charge of helping Pyle improve. One evening while doing a hygiene inspection, Hartman notices that Pyle\\'s footlocker is unlocked. As he inspects it for signs of theft, he discovers a jelly doughnut inside, blames the platoon for Pyle\\'s infractions, and adopts a collective punishment policy in which any infraction committed by Pyle will earn a punishment for everyone else in the platoon. The next night, the recruits haze Pyle with a blanket party, in which Joker reluctantly participates. Following this, Pyle appears to reinvent himself as a model recruit, showing particular expertise in marksmanship. This pleases Hartman but worries Joker, who believes Pyle may be suffering a mental breakdown after seeing Pyle talking to his rifle. The recruits graduate, but the night before they leave Parris Island, Joker, who is on fire watch duty, discovers Pyle in the barracks latrine loading his service rifle with live ammunition, executing drill commands, and loudly reciting the Rifleman\\'s Creed. Hartman is awoken by the commotion and attempts to intervene, but Pyle shoots and kills him before committing suicide, leaving Joker horrified.\\nBy January 1968, Joker is a sergeant and is based in Da Nang for the newspaper Stars and Stripes alongside his colleague Private First Class Rafterman, a combat photographer. The Tet Offensive begins and Joker\\'s base is attacked, but holds. The following morning, Joker and Rafterman are sent to Phu Bai where Joker searches for and reunites with Sergeant \"Cowboy\", a friend he met at Parris Island. During the Battle of Huế, a booby trap kills the squad leader, leaving Cowboy in command. Becoming lost in the city, the squad is ambushed by a Viet Cong sniper who kills two members. As the squad moves in on the sniper\\'s location, Cowboy is killed.\\nAssuming command, squad machine gunner \"Animal Mother\" leads an attack on the sniper. Joker locates her first, but his M16 rifle jams, alerting the sniper to his presence. As the sniper opens fire, she is revealed to be a teenage girl. Rafterman shoots her, wounding her mortally. As the squad converges on the sniper, she begs for death, leading to an argument over whether or not to kill her. Animal Mother agrees to a mercy killing but only if Joker does it; after some hesitation, Joker shoots her. Later, as night falls, the Marines return to camp singing the \"Mickey Mouse March\". A narration of Joker\\'s thoughts conveys that, despite being \"in a world of shit\", he is glad to be alive and no longer afraid.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'A Clockwork Orange': 'In a futuristic Britain, Alex DeLarge is the leader of a gang of \"droogs\": Georgie, Dim and Pete. One night, after getting intoxicated on drug-laden \"milk-plus\", they engage in an evening of \"ultra-violence\", which includes a fight with a rival gang. They drive to the country home of writer Frank Alexander and trick his wife into letting them inside. They beat Alexander to the point of crippling him, and Alex violently rapes Alexander\\'s wife while singing \"Singin\\' in the Rain\". The next day, while truant from school, Alex is approached by his probation officer, PR Deltoid, who is aware of Alex\\'s activities and cautions him.\\nAlex\\'s droogs express discontent with petty crime and want more equality and high-yield thefts, but Alex asserts his authority by attacking them. Later, Alex invades the home of a wealthy \"cat-lady\" and bludgeons her with a phallic sculpture while his droogs remain outside. On hearing sirens, Alex tries to flee, but Dim smashes a bottle in his face, stunning Alex and leaving him to be arrested. Deltoid brings word that the woman has died of her injuries, and Alex is convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison.\\nTwo years into the sentence, Alex eagerly takes up an offer to be a test subject for the Minister of the Interior\\'s new Ludovico technique, an experimental aversion therapy for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks. Alex is strapped to a chair, his eyes are clamped open, and he is injected with drugs. He is then forced to watch films of sex and violence, some of which are accompanied by the music of his favourite composer, Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex becomes nauseated by the films and, fearing the technique will make him sick upon hearing Beethoven, begs for an end to the treatment.\\nTwo weeks later, the Minister demonstrates Alex\\'s rehabilitation to a gathering of officials. Alex is unable to fight back against an actor who taunts and attacks him and becomes ill upon seeing a topless woman. The prison chaplain complains that Alex has been robbed of his free will; the Minister asserts that the Ludovico technique will cut crime and alleviate crowding in prisons.\\nAlex is released from prison, only to find that the police have sold his possessions to provide compensation to his victims and his parents have let out his room. Alex encounters an elderly vagrant whom he attacked years earlier, and the vagrant and his friends attack him. Alex is saved by two policemen but is shocked to find they are his former droogs Dim and Georgie. They drive him to the countryside, beat him, and nearly drown him before abandoning him. Alex barely makes it to the doorstep of a nearby home before collapsing.\\nAlex wakes up to find himself in the home of Mr Alexander, who is now using a wheelchair. Alexander does not recognise Alex from the previous attack, but knows of him and the Ludovico technique from the newspapers. He sees Alex as a political weapon and prepares to present him to his colleagues. While bathing, Alex breaks into \"Singin\\' in the Rain\", causing Alexander to realise that Alex was the person who assaulted his wife and him. With help from his colleagues, Alexander drugs Alex and locks him in an upstairs bedroom. He then plays Beethoven\\'s Ninth Symphony loudly from the floor below. Unable to withstand the sickening pain, Alex attempts suicide by jumping out of the window.\\nAlex survives the attempt and wakes up in hospital with multiple injuries. While being given a series of psychological tests, he finds that he no longer has aversions to violence and sex. The Minister arrives and apologises to Alex. He informs Alex that the government has had Mr Alexander institutionalised. He offers to take care of Alex and get him a job in return for his co-operation with his election campaign and public relations counter-offensive. As a sign of goodwill, the Minister brings in a stereo system playing Beethoven\\'s Ninth. Alex then contemplates violence and has vivid thoughts of having sex with a woman in front of an approving crowd, thinking to himself, \"I was cured, all right!\"\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Incendies': \"Following the death of their mother Nawal, an Arab immigrant in Canada, Jeanne and her twin brother Simon meet with French Canadian notary Jean Lebel, their mother's employer and family friend. Nawal's will makes reference to not keeping a promise, denying her a proper gravestone and casket, unless Jeanne and Simon track down their mysterious brother, whose existence they were previously unaware of, and their father, who they believed was dead. Nawal has left two letters; one is to be delivered to Jeanne and Simon's father, and the other is to be delivered to their brother. Jeanne accepts; Simon, on the other hand, seemingly having had a more difficult relationship with Nawal and her apparently unusual personality, is reluctant to join Jeanne on this pursuit.\\nA series of flashbacks reveal Nawal came from a Christian Arab family in an unnamed Levantine country, and that she fell in love with a refugee named Wahab, resulting in her pregnancy. Her family murders her lover and nearly shoots her as an honour killing, but her grandmother spares her, making her promise to leave the village after the birth of her baby and start a new life in the fictional city of Daresh. The grandmother tattoos the back of the baby's heel and sends him to an orphanage.\\nWhile Nawal is at university in Daresh, a civil war and war crimes break out with Nawal opposing the war on human rights grounds. Her son's orphanage in Kfar Khout is destroyed by a Muslim militant, Chamseddine, who converts him into an Islamic child soldier. After barely escaping the massacre of a bus full of Muslim refugees by Christian Nationalists, Nawal narrowly manages to join the Muslim fighters, and eventually shoots a nationalist leader. She is imprisoned in Kfar Ryat and raped by torturer Abou Tarek, consequently giving birth to the twins.\\nAfter travelling to her mother's native country, Jeanne gradually uncovers this past, and persuades Simon to join her. With help from Lebel, they learn their brother's name is Nihad of May and track down Chamseddine. Simon meets with him personally, and he reveals the war-mad Nihad was captured by the nationalists, turned by them, trained as a torturer, and then sent to Kfar Ryat, where he took the name Abou Tarek, making him both the twins' half-brother and father; as such, both letters are addressed to the same person. Like Nawal, Nihad's superiors gave him a new life in Canada after the war. By chance, Nawal encountered him at a Canadian swimming pool, and saw both the tattoo (showing him as her son) and his face (showing him as her rapist). The shock of learning the truth caused Nawal to suffer a stroke which led to her decline and untimely death at age sixty.\\nThe twins find Nihad in Canada and deliver Nawal's letters to him. He opens both of them; the first letter addresses him as the twins' father, the rapist, and is filled with contempt. The second letter addresses him as the twins' brother, and is instead written with caring words, saying that he, as Nawal's son, is deserving of love.\\nNawal gets her gravestone.  Some time later, Nihad visits it.\\n\\n\\n== Cast\", 'Hamilton': 'Hamilton narrates Alexander Hamilton\\'s life in two acts, and details among other things his involvement in the American Revolutionary War as an aide-de-camp to George Washington, his marriage to Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, his career as a lawyer and secretary of the treasury, and his interactions with Aaron Burr which culminates in their duel at the end of Hamilton\\'s life.\\n\\n\\n=== Act I ===\\nThe orphan Alexander Hamilton experiences a hard early life, and through his smarts and the charitability of the townsfolks leaves his home, the island of Nevis (\"Alexander Hamilton\"). As a student at King\\'s College in New York in 1776, Hamilton meets Aaron Burr, John Laurens, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Hercules Mulligan (\"Aaron Burr, Sir\"), and impresses them with his rhetorical skills (\"My Shot\"). The latter three and Hamilton affirm their revolutionary goals to each other, while Burr remains apprehensive (\"The Story of Tonight\"). Later, the daughters of the wealthy Philip Schuyler—Peggy, Angelica, and Eliza—go into town and share their opinion on the upcoming revolution (\"The Schuyler Sisters\"). Loyalist bishop Samuel Seabury argues against the revolution (\"Farmer Refuted\") and King George III insists on his authority (\"You\\'ll Be Back\"). During the New York and New Jersey campaign, Hamilton accepts a position as George Washington\\'s aide-de-camp despite longing for field command (\"Right Hand Man\").\\nAt a ball hosted by Philip Schuyler (\"A Winter\\'s Ball\"), Eliza falls helplessly in love with Hamilton, who reciprocates her feelings to the point of marriage (\"Helpless\"), as Angelica suppresses her own feelings for the sake of their happiness (\"Satisfied\"). After the wedding, Burr and Hamilton congratulate each other\\'s successes (\"The Story of Tonight (Reprise)\") while Burr reflects on Hamilton\\'s swift rise while considering his own more cautious career as well as his affair with Theodosia, the wife of a British officer (\"Wait For It\").\\nAs conditions worsen for the Continental Army (\"Stay Alive\"), Hamilton aids Laurens in a duel against Major General Charles Lee (\"Ten Duel Commandments\"), after which Washington temporarily suspends him from the army (\"Meet Me Inside\"). Back home, Eliza reveals that she is pregnant with their first child, Philip, and asks Hamilton to slow down to take in what has happened in their lives (\"That Would Be Enough\"). After Lafayette persuades France to get involved on the colonists\\' side, he urges Washington to call Hamilton back to help plan the final Battle of Yorktown. Washington agrees (\"Guns and Ships\"), but explains to Hamilton, who is convinced that he should die a martyr and a hero in war, that he should be wary of what he does next because whatever he does will be known for all time (\"History Has Its Eyes on You\"). At the Battle of Yorktown, Hamilton meets up with Lafayette to take down the British, revealing that Mulligan was recruited as a spy, helping them figure out how to trap the British and win the war (\"Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\").\\nSoon after the victory of Yorktown, King George asks the newborn America how it will succeed on its own (\"What Comes Next?\"). Hamilton\\'s son Philip is born, while Burr has a daughter, Theodosia, and the two tell their children how they will do anything to protect them (\"Dear Theodosia\"). Hamilton receives word that his long-time friend John Laurens has been killed in a seemingly pointless battle after the war was won and throws himself into his work (\"The Laurens Interlude/Tomorrow There\\'ll Be More Of Us\"). He co-authors The Federalist Papers and is selected as Secretary of the Treasury by newly elected President Washington, amidst Eliza begging Hamilton to stay and Angelica moving to London with her new husband (\"Non-Stop\").\\n\\n\\n=== Act II ===\\nIn 1789, Thomas Jefferson returns to America from being the U.S. ambassador to France, taking up his newfound position as Secretary of State (\"What\\'d I Miss\"). Jefferson and Madison debate Hamilton\\'s financial proposals at a Cabinet meeting. Washington tells Hamilton to figure out a compromise to win over Congress (\"Cabinet Battle #1\"). Eliza and her family—along with Angelica, back from London—travel upstate during the summer, while Hamilton stays home to work on the compromise (\"Take a Break\"). Hamilton begins an affair with Maria Reynolds, making him vulnerable to her husband\\'s blackmail (\"Say No To This\"). Hamilton, Jefferson, and James Madison create the Compromise of 1790 over a private dinner, exchanging Hamilton\\'s financial plan for placing the country\\'s permanent capital on the Potomac River. Burr is envious of Hamilton\\'s sway in the government and wishes that he had similar power (\"The Room Where It Happens\"). Burr switches political parties and defeats Philip Schuyler in a race for the Senate, now making Hamilton a rival (\"Schuyler Defeated\").\\nIn another Cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in its conflict with Britain. President Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton\\'s argument for remaining neutral (\"Cabinet Battle #2\"). In the wake of this, Jefferson, Madison, and Burr decide to join forces to find a way to discredit Hamilton (\"Washington on Your Side\"). Washington retires from the presidency after his second term, and Hamilton assists in writing a farewell address (\"One Last Time\"). A flabbergasted King George receives word that George Washington has stepped down, and will be replaced by Paris signatory John Adams (\"I Know Him\"). Adams becomes the second President and fires Hamilton, who, in response, publishes an inflammatory critique of the new president (\"The Adams Administration\").\\nJefferson, Madison, and Burr confront Hamilton about James Reynolds\\'s blackmail, accusing him of \"[embezzlement of] government funds\" (\"We Know\"). Desperate to salvage his political career by proving that he was merely lustful and not corrupt, Hamilton reminisces over his life and how writing has changed his life (\"Hurricane\"), before prophylactically publicizing his affair in the Reynolds Pamphlet, which wrecks his own reputation (\"The Reynolds Pamphlet\"). It also damages his relationship with Eliza, who, in a heartbroken retaliation, burns all the letters Hamilton wrote her, trying to erase herself from history (\"Burn\"). After graduating from college, Philip attempts to defend his father\\'s honor in a duel with George Eacker (\"Blow Us All Away\") but is fatally shot (\"Stay Alive (Reprise)\"), eventually leading to reconciliation between Alexander and Eliza (\"It\\'s Quiet Uptown\").\\nHamilton\\'s endorsement of Jefferson in the 1800 United States presidential election (\"The Election of 1800\") results in further animosity between Hamilton and Burr, who challenges Hamilton to a duel via an exchange of letters (\"Your Obedient Servant\"). Hamilton writes his last letter in a rush while Eliza tells him to go back to bed (\"Best of Wives and Best of Women\"). Burr reflects on the moments leading up to the duel, while Hamilton reflects on his legacy, before throwing away his shot. Burr fatally shoots Hamilton, and laments that though he survived, he is destined to be remembered as the villain who killed Hamilton (\"The World Was Wide Enough\"). The musical closes with a reflection on historical memory. Jefferson and Madison reflect on Hamilton\\'s legacy, as Eliza tells how she keeps Hamilton\\'s legacy alive through interviewing war veterans, getting help from Angelica, raising funds for the Washington Monument, speaking out against slavery, and establishing the first private orphanage in New York City (\"Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story\"). The musical ends with Hamilton shaking Eliza\\'s hand. Eliza then turns towards the audience and lets out a tearful gasp.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'To Kill a Mockingbird': 'Narration is by the adult Jean Louise \"Scout\" Finch. \\n\\nYoung Scout and her older brother Jem live in Maycomb, Alabama, during the early 1930s. Despite the family\\'s modest means, the children enjoy a happy childhood with their widowed father, Atticus Finch, and their African-American housekeeper, Calpurnia.\\nOver the summer, Jem, Scout, and their friend Dill play games and often search for Arthur \"Boo\" Radley, an odd, reclusive neighbor who lives with his brother Nathan. The children have never seen Boo, who rarely leaves the house. Occasionally, Jem has found small objects left inside a tree knothole on the Radley property. These include a broken pocket watch, an old spelling bee medal, a pocket knife, and two carved soap dolls resembling Jem and Scout.\\nAtticus, a lawyer, strongly believes all people deserve fair treatment, in turning the other cheek, and in defending what you believe. Many of Atticus\\' clients are poor farmers who pay for his legal services in trade, often leaving him fresh produce, firewood, and so on. Atticus\\' work as a lawyer often exposes Scout and Jem to the town\\'s racism, aggravated by poverty. As a result, the children mature more quickly.\\nAtticus chooses to defend Tom Robinson, an African-American accused of raping a Caucasian girl, Mayella Ewell. This heightens tension in the town and causes Jem and Scout to experience schoolyard taunts.\\nOne evening before the trial, Atticus sits out front to safeguard Robinson, where a lynch mob arrives. Scout, Jem, and Dill unexpectedly interrupt the confrontation. Scout, unaware of the mob\\'s purpose, recognizes Mr. Cunningham and asks him to say hello to his son Walter, her classmate. He becomes embarrassed, and the mob disperses.\\nAt the trial, it is alleged that Tom entered the Ewell property at Mayella\\'s request to chop up a chifforobe and that Mayella showed signs of having been beaten around that time. One of Atticus\\' defensive arguments is that Tom\\'s left arm is disabled due to a farming accident years ago, yet the supposed rapist would have had to mostly assault Mayella with his left hand before raping her.\\nAtticus shows that Mayella\\'s father, Bob Ewell, is left-handed, implying that he beat Mayella because he caught her seducing the young African-American defendant. He also states that Mayella was never examined by a doctor after the alleged rape. Taking the stand, Tom denies he attacked Mayella, but states that she kissed him against his will. He testifies that he had previously assisted Mayella with various chores at her request because he \"felt sorry for her\" – words that incite a swift, negative reaction from the prosecutor, and a gasp from the Caucasian audience.\\nIn his closing argument, Atticus asks the all-Caucasian male jury to cast aside their prejudices and focus on Tom\\'s obvious innocence. However, Tom is found guilty. As Atticus exits the courtroom, the African-American spectators in the balcony rise to show their respect and appreciation.\\nWhen Atticus arrives home, Sheriff Tate tells him Tom was killed during his transfer to prison, supposedly while attempting to escape. Atticus goes to the Robinson\\'s to inform them of Tom\\'s death, accompanied by Jem. Bob Ewell appears and spits in his face.\\nAutumn arrives, and Scout and Jem attend an evening school pageant in which Scout portrays a ham. After the pageant, Scout is unable to find her dress and shoes, forcing her to walk home with Jem while wearing the large, hard-shelled costume. While cutting through the woods, Scout and Jem are attacked. Scout\\'s cumbersome costume protects her but restricts her vision. The attacker knocks Jem unconscious, but is himself attacked (and killed) by a second man, unseen by Scout. Scout escapes her costume and sees the second man carrying Jem towards their house. Scout follows them and runs into the arms of a frantic Atticus. Still unconscious, Jem has his broken arm treated by Doc Reynolds.\\nScout tells Sheriff Tate and her father what happened, then notices a strange man behind Jem\\'s bedroom door. Atticus introduces Scout to Arthur Radley, whom she knows as Boo. It was Boo who rescued Jem and Scout, overpowering Bob Ewell and carrying Jem home. The sheriff reports that Ewell, apparently seeking revenge for Atticus humiliating him in court, is dead at the scene of the attack. Atticus mistakenly assumes Jem killed Ewell in self-defense, but Sheriff Tate realizes the truth – Boo killed Ewell defending the children. His official report will state that Ewell died falling on his knife.\\nTate refuses to drag the painfully shy, introverted, likely autistic Boo into the spotlight for his heroism, insisting it would be a sin. As Scout escorts Boo home, she draws a startlingly precocious analogy: comparing the unwelcome public attention that would have been heaped on Boo, with the killing of a mockingbird that does nothing but sing.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Sting': 'In 1936 Great Depression America, Johnny Hooker, a grifter in Joliet, Illinois, with partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie, cons $11,000 in cash from an unsuspecting victim. Buoyed by the windfall, Luther decides to retire and tells Hooker to seek out his old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to learn \"the big con\". However, corrupt Joliet police lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing that their mark was a courier for vicious Irish-American crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Lonnegan\\'s men murder both the courier and Luther, and Hooker flees to Chicago (Erie\\'s involvement remains unknown to Lonnegan).\\nHooker finds Gondorff, now hiding from the FBI running a carousel (actually a front for a brothel), and asks for his help in taking down Lonnegan. Gondorff, aware of Lonnegan\\'s reputation, is reluctant, but relents and recruits a team of experienced con men. They decide to resurrect an elaborate, obsolete scam known as \"the wire\", using a large crew to create a phony off-track betting parlor. Both Snyder and Lonnegan\\'s men track Hooker to Chicago; Gondorff warns Hooker that if either of them find him, the con will have to fold.\\nAboard the opulent 20th Century Limited, Gondorff, posing as boorish Chicago bookie \"Shaw\", buys into Lonnegan\\'s private, high-stakes poker game and infuriates Lonnegan with obnoxious behavior, then cheats him out of $15,000. Hooker, posing as Shaw\\'s disgruntled employee \"Kelly\", is sent to collect the winnings and instead convinces Lonnegan that he wants Lonnegan\\'s help to take over \"Shaw\"\\'s operation. Lonnegan, sufficiently roused against \"Shaw\", takes the bait. Hooker returns home to find Lonnegan\\'s men waiting for him, but avoids their pursuit; Gondorff is spooked by their proximity, but Hooker convinces him to keep the con alive.\\nSnyder\\'s pursuit of Hooker attracts the attention of undercover FBI agents led by Agent Polk, who orders Snyder to bring Hooker in to entrap Gondorff. At the same time, Lonnegan has grown frustrated with his men\\'s inability to find and kill Hooker for the Joliet con, and orders Salino, his best assassin, be given the job. A mysterious figure with black leather gloves begins following and observing Hooker. \\n\"Kelly\" gives Lonnegan a tip on a 7-to-1 long shot that pays off; when Lonnegan presses him for details, he reveals that he has a partner, \"Les Harmon\" (actually con man Kid Twist) in the Chicago Western Union office, who will help them topple \"Shaw\" by winning bets he books on horse races through past-posting. Lonnegan is convinced after being provided the trifecta of another race, and agrees to finance a $500,000 bet to break \"Shaw\" and get revenge. Shortly thereafter, Snyder captures Hooker and brings him before Polk, who forces Hooker to betray Gondorff by threatening to jail Luther Coleman\\'s widow.\\nFeeling despondent the night before the sting, Hooker sleeps with a diner waitress named Loretta. The next morning, as she walks toward him in an alley, the black-gloved man appears and shoots her dead. The man reveals that he was hired by Gondorff to protect Hooker and reveals that the waitress was in fact Salino.\\nLonnegan bets $500,000 at \"Shaw\"\\'s parlor on Lucky Dan to win, at 4-to-1 odds. As the race begins, \"Harmon\" arrives and expresses shock at Lonnegan\\'s bet: when he said \"place it\" he meant that Lucky Dan would \"place\" (i.e., finish second). In a panic, Lonnegan rushes to the teller window and demands his money back, at which point Polk, Snyder, and a half dozen FBI agents storm the parlor. Polk tells Hooker he is free to go; shocked at the betrayal, Gondorff shoots Hooker in the back. Polk shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get the ostensibly respectable Lonnegan away from the crime scene. With Lonnegan and Snyder safely away, Hooker and Gondorff rise amid cheers and laughter: \"Polk\" is actually Hickey, running a con within the con to divert Snyder and ensure that Lonnegan abandons the money and never knows he was taken. As the con men strip the room of its contents, Hooker refuses his share of the money and walks away with Gondorff.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'A Separation': \"Nader, Simin, and their 11-year-old daughter, Termeh, are a secular, middle-class family living in a flat in Tehran. Simin wants the whole family to leave Iran and has prepared the visas, but Nader wishes to stay to care for his father, who lives with them, and has Alzheimer's disease. Simin therefore files for divorce, but the family court considers the grounds to be insufficient and rejects the application. Simin moves back to her parents’ home and Termeh stays with her father.\\nNader hires Razieh, a deeply religious woman from a poor and distant suburb, to take care of his father during the day. She comes each day with her young daughter, Somayeh. She soon finds that she cannot cope, in particular because the old man has become incontinent. One day, when Razieh and Somayeh are busy, he slips out and wanders in the street. Razieh hastens out and dodges through the traffic to get to him.\\nThe next day, Nader and Termeh come home early and discover the old man lying unconscious on the floor in his bedroom, tied to the bed. Razieh and Somayeh are out. When they return, Razieh says she had some urgent personal business; Nader accuses her of neglecting his father and stealing some money (which Simin had in fact used to pay some movers). When Razieh refuses to leave until he pays her, he pushes her out of the flat. She apparently falls down some steps. Nader and Simin later learn that Razieh has suffered a miscarriage.\\nIf Nader knew of Razieh's pregnancy and caused the miscarriage, he could be guilty of murder. There is now a series of claims and counter-claims before a criminal judge: on one side, Nader, with Simin and Termeh; on the other, Razieh and her husband, Hodjat. He is a hot-tempered man, embittered and humiliated by the loss of his long-time job as a cobbler, and harassed by creditors. More than once, he attempts to assault Nader.\\nRazieh says that Nader knew of her pregnancy because he heard a conversation in the flat between her and Termeh’s tutor, in which the tutor recommended a doctor to her. Nader denies this, and the tutor gives evidence in his support. Termeh finds reasons to believe this is not true, and Nader at last admits to her that he has lied for her sake and his father’s: he cannot go to prison. The tutor withdraws her evidence. To protect her father, Termeh tells the judge that her father did not know of the pregnancy until she told him.\\nNader claims that when he pushed Razieh out of the flat, she could not have fallen down the steps, but would have been protected by the railing. Razieh confesses to Simin that when she went out to bring back the old man, she was hit by a car and was in pain that night; this was the day before Nader pushed her, and she had gone out that day to see a doctor.\\nHodjat is violent, and Simin fears for Termeh’s safety. Simin persuades Nader to make a payment to Hodjat, but Nader first asks Razieh to swear on the Qur'an that he is the cause of her miscarriage. She cannot do so. Hodjat cannot force her, and begins hitting himself in a rage.\\nLater, at the family court, Nader and Simin are granted a divorce. As the film ends, they wait separately outside the court while Termeh tells the judge which parent she chooses to live with.\\n\\n\\n== Cast\", 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade': \"In 1912, while exploring caves with his Boy Scout troop in Utah, a teenage Indiana Jones discovers graverobbers taking a gold crucifix from the tomb of Coronado.

Indy tries to save the Grail from falling, but Henry convinces him to let it go. Indy and his companions manage to escape, riding off into the sunset.\\n\\n\\n== Cast\", 'Metropolis': 'In the future, wealthy industrialists and business magnates and their top employees reign over the city of Metropolis from colossal skyscrapers, while underground-dwelling workers toil to operate the great machines that power it.

Maria and the children are ushered away, but Freder becomes fascinated by her and goes to the lower levels to find her. In the machine halls, he witnesses the explosion of a huge machine that kills and injures numerous workers. Freder has a hallucination that the machine is a temple of Moloch and the workers are being fed to it. When the hallucination ends, and he sees the dead workers being carried away on stretchers, he hurries to tell his father about the accident.\\nGrot, foreman of the Heart Machine, brings Fredersen secret maps found on the dead workers. Fredersen fires his assistant Josaphat for not being the first to bring him details about the explosion or the maps. After seeing his father\\'s cold indifference towards the harsh conditions faced by the workers, Freder secretly rebels against him by deciding to help the workers. He enlists Josaphat\\'s assistance and returns to the machine halls, where he trades places with a worker who has collapsed from exhaustion.\\nFredersen takes the maps to the inventor Rotwang to learn their meaning. Rotwang had been in love with a woman named Hel, who left him to marry Fredersen and later died giving birth to Freder. Rotwang shows Fredersen a robot he has built to \"resurrect\" Hel. The maps show a network of catacombs beneath Metropolis, and the two men go to investigate. They eavesdrop on a gathering of workers, including Freder. Maria addresses them, prophesying the arrival of a mediator who can bring the working and ruling classes together. Freder believes he can fill the role and declares his love for Maria. \\nFredersen orders Rotwang to give Maria\\'s likeness to the robot so that it can discredit her among the workers, but is unaware that Rotwang plans to use the robot to destroy Metropolis and ruin both Fredersen and Freder.

He volunteers to testify against corrupt officers involved in the \"Bloody Christmas\" case in exchange for promotion to detective lieutenant, against the advice of precinct captain Dudley Smith.\\nPlainclothes officer Wendell \"Bud\" White is obsessed with punishing men who abuse women, his own mother having been beaten to death by his father. White hates Exley because his partner, Dick Stensland, was fired thanks to Exley\\'s testimony. With gangster Mickey Cohen imprisoned for tax evasion, Smith recruits White to torture and frighten away out-of-town criminals trying to gain a foothold in Los Angeles. White also encounters Lynn Bracken, a sex worker resembling Veronica Lake, and former cop Leland \"Buzz\" Meeks. Both work for Pierce Patchett, whose Fleur-de-Lis service runs high-end prostitutes altered by plastic surgery to resemble film stars.\\nSergeant Jack Vincennes is a narcotics detective who moonlights as a technical adviser on Badge of Honor, a TV police drama series. Sid Hudgens, publisher of the Hush-Hush tabloid magazine, tips Vincennes on celebrity criminal activity so that he can make high-profile arrests for Sid\\'s publication.\\nExley soon investigates a robbery and multiple homicide at the Nite Owl coffee shop. Stensland was one of the victims. Exley and Vincennes arrest three African-American felons for the crime, who later escape from police custody and are killed by Exley in a shootout. Exley is decorated for bravery. Although the Nite Owl case appears solved, Exley and White each investigate further, discovering evidence of corruption all around them. White begins a relationship with Lynn, and recognizes Nite Owl victim Susan Lefferts as one of Patchett\\'s escorts. Lefferts\\' mother tells White that Stensland was Susan\\'s \"boyfriend\"; White searches the crawl space under the mother\\'s house and finds Meeks\\'s corpse.

Smith shoots Vincennes, who dies after murmuring \"Rollo Tomasi\".\\nThe next day, Exley becomes suspicious when Smith asks him who \"Rollo Tomasi\" is; a name Exley revealed solely to Vincennes. While interrogating Hudgens, Smith arranges for White to see photos of Lynn having sex with Exley, which sends an enraged White to find him. At the police station, White and Exley fight, but stop when both realize that Smith is corrupt. They deduce that Stensland killed Meeks over the stolen heroin, and that the Nite Owl killings were to allow Smith to kill Stensland. Smith\\'s men framed the three African-Americans for the Nite Owl murders with planted evidence. Exley and White interrogate Loew and learn that Smith and Patchett (aided by Hudgens\\' blackmail photos) have been taking over Cohen\\'s criminal empire, and that the killings were because of Smith tying up loose ends. They later find Patchett and Hudgens murdered.\\nSmith lures Exley and White into an ambush. After the pair kill Smith\\'s hitmen in a gunfight, White and Smith wound each other.

His father, Nandkishore is a successful executive who expects his sons to excel, and his mother, Maya is a homemaker who is frustrated by her inability to educate Ishaan. Ishaan's elder brother, Yohan is an exemplary student in whose shadow Ishaan remains. One day, Ishaan and his parents are called by Ishaan's principal to discuss about his behavior and grades. Fed up of hearing Ishaan's failures and lack of improvement, Nandkishore sends Ishaan to a boarding school. Alone there, he rapidly sinks into a state of fear, anxiety, and depression, which is only worsened by the teachers there and their strict and abusive regime.

He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of dyslexia. Ram then visits the Awasthi's house in Mumbai, where he is surprised to discover Ishaan's hidden interest in art. Flustered, he demonstrates to Maya and Yohan how Ishaan has extreme difficulty in understanding letters and words due to dyslexia, and his poverty in sports skills stems from his poor motor ability (which also applies to his difficulty in tying shoelaces).

They separately learn that a ruthless, cold-blooded bank robber, \"El Indio\", has been broken out of prison by his gang, who slaughtered all but one of his jailers. While Indio is murdering the family of the man who had captured him, he is shown to carry a musical pocket watch taken from a woman who had shot herself while he was raping her after he had murdered her husband. The incident has haunted Indio, and he smokes an addictive drug to cloud his memory.\\nIndio plans to rob the Bank of El Paso, which has a disguised safe containing \"almost a million dollars.\" Manco arrives in the town and becomes aware of Mortimer, who had arrived earlier. He sees Mortimer deliberately insult the hunchback Wild, who is reconnoitering the bank. Manco confronts Mortimer, and after the two have studied each other, each ascertaining that the other will not back down, they decide to work together. Mortimer persuades Manco to join Indio\\'s gang and \"get him between two fires.\" Manco achieves this by freeing a friend of Indio from prison despite Indio\\'s suspicions.\\nIndio sends Manco and three others to rob the bank in nearby Santa Cruz. Manco guns down the three bandits and sends a false telegraphic alarm to rouse the El Paso sheriff and his posse, who ride to Santa Cruz. The gang blasts the wall at the rear of the El Paso bank and steals the safe, but is unable to open it. Groggy is angry when Manco is the only one to return from Santa Cruz, but Indio accepts Manco\\'s version of events thanks to Mortimer having given Manco a convincing neck wound. The gang ride to the small border town of Agua Caliente where Mortimer, who had anticipated their destination, is waiting. Wild recognizes Mortimer, forcing a showdown that results in the hunchback\\'s death, whereafter Mortimer offers his services to Indio to crack open the safe without using explosives. Indio locks the money in a strongbox and says the loot will be divided after a month.\\nManco and Mortimer break into the strongbox and hide the money, only to be caught immediately afterward and beaten up. Mortimer has secured the strongbox lock, however, and Indio believes that the money is still there. Later that night, Indio instructs his lieutenant, Niño, to use a knife belonging to Cuchillo to kill the man guarding Manco and Mortimer. Once Niño has freed the prisoners, Indio reveals that he knew they were bounty hunters all along, and executes Cuchillo for supposedly betraying the gang. Indio orders the rest of his men to bring back Manco and Mortimer, hoping they will all kill each other and he and Niño can split the money just between themselves. However, Groggy realizes the scheme, and after killing Niño, forces Indio to open the strongbox, which is found to be empty.\\nEventually, after he and Manco kill the bandits, Mortimer calls out Indio while revealing his full name. Mortimer shoots Groggy as he runs for cover, but is disarmed by Indio, who plays the pocket watch while challenging the bounty hunter to regain his weapon and kill him when the music ends. As the music ends, the same tune begins from an identical pocket watch that Manco had pilfered from Mortimer. Manco gives his gunbelt and pistol to Mortimer, saying, \"Now we start.\" When the music ends, Mortimer shoots first, killing Indio.\\nMortimer retrieves the watch from Indio\\'s hand and Manco remarks on Mortimer\\'s resemblance to the woman in the vignette photo inside the watch cover. Mortimer reveals that he is her brother (father in the Spanish dubbing), and with his revenge complete, declines his share of the bounty and leaves.

An actual millionaire, the much-married, aging, mama\\'s-boy Osgood Fielding III, persistently pursues \"Daphne\", whose refusals only increase his appetite. He invites \"her\" for a champagne supper on his yacht, New Caledonia. Joe convinces Jerry to keep Osgood occupied onshore so that \"Junior\" can take Sugar to Osgood\\'s yacht and pass it off as his own. Once on the yacht, \"Junior\" tells Sugar that psychological trauma has left him impotent and frigid, but that he would marry anyone who could cure him.

Rothschild, employed under Mark Hanna. He is quickly enticed by the drug-fueled stockbroker culture and Hanna\\'s belief that a broker\\'s only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan loses his job following Black Monday, the largest one-day stock market drop in history after the 1929 stock market crash, and takes a job at a boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks. He makes a small fortune thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions.\\nJordan befriends his neighbor Donnie Azoff, and the two start their own boiler room styled brokerage company. They recruit Jordan\\'s childhood friends Robbie Feinberg, Alden Kupferburg, Nicky Koskoff, Chester Ming, and Toby Welch, as well as local drug pusher Brad Bonick, all of whom Jordan trains in the art of the \"hard sell\", and set up the company in an abandoned auto repair shop. Jordan\\'s tactics and salesmanship largely contribute to the success of his pump and dump scheme, in which misleading, positive statements inflate a stock\\'s price so it can be sold at an artificially high price. When the scheme\\'s perpetrators sell their overvalued securities, the price plummets, and those who were conned into buying at the inflated price are left with stock that is suddenly worth much less than they paid for it. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name Stratton Oakmont in 1989. Soon after, the company becomes immensely successful, moving out of the auto repair shop into a bigger office. An exposé in Forbes, which dubs Jordan \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"a twisted Robin Hood who steals from the rich and gives to himself and his merry band of brokers\", causes hundreds of ambitious young financiers to flock to the company, thus causing them to move into even bigger offices.\\nAs all this is happening, Jordan becomes immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia and when his wife Teresa finds out about this, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi in 1991. Meanwhile, the SEC and the FBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont.\\nIn 1993, Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours after securing the IPO of Donnie\\'s childhood friend and shoe designer Steve Madden. This brings him and his firm further FBI attention. To hide his money, Jordan opens a Swiss bank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi\\'s aunt Emma, who is a British subject and thus outside the immediate reach of American authorities. He uses the wife and in-laws of Brad, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland.\\nDonnie and Brad get into a heated argument in public during a money exchange, resulting in Brad\\'s arrest, but Donnie escapes. Jordan learns from his private investigator that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. Fearing for his son, Jordan\\'s father advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan\\'s lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison, but Jordan cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech.\\nIn 1996, Jordan, Donnie, and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Emma has died. Jordan proceeds to Switzerland to forge her name and save the account before going to London to attend her funeral. To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship capsizes in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine; Jordan takes this as a sign from God to address his worsening drug addiction and attempts to sober up.\\nIn 1998, Saurel and Koskoff get arrested for a separate crime and inform the FBI about Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on the rest of his colleagues in exchange for leniency. After having sex for the last time, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their daughter and infant son. In a cocaine-fueled rage, Jordan hits Naomi and tries to drive away with his daughter but crashes his car in the driveway.\\nLater, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie, warning him. The FBI discovers this, arrests Jordan, and raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite breaching his deal, Jordan receives a reduced sentence of 36 months in a minimum security prison for his testimony and is released in 2000 after serving 22 months. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales techniques.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Father': 'Anne visits her father Anthony in his flat after he has driven away the latest of several caregivers.

Haywood is particularly interested in learning how the defendant Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster), a respected jurist and legal scholar, could have committed the atrocities he is accused of, including sentencing innocent people to death. \\nHaywood seeks to understand how the German people could have been deaf and blind to the Nazi regime\\'s crimes. In doing so, he befriends the widow (Marlene Dietrich) of a German general who had been executed by the Allies. He talks with other Germans who have varying perspectives on the war. \\nOther characters the judge meets are US Army Captain Harrison Byers (William Shatner), who is assigned to assist the American judges hearing the case, and Irene Hoffmann (Judy Garland), who is afraid to provide testimony that may bolster the prosecution\\'s case against the judges. (Hoffman\\'s character bears resemblance to Irene Seiler, a key figure in the notorious Nazi kangaroo court case, the Katzenberger Trial.)\\nGerman defense attorney Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell) argues that the defendants were not the only ones to aid or ignore the Nazi regime. He claims the United States has committed acts just as bad or worse than the Nazis, such as US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.\\'s support for the first eugenics practices; the German-Vatican Reichskonkordat of 1933, which the Nazi-dominated German government exploited as an implicit early foreign recognition of Nazi leadership; Joseph Stalin\\'s part in the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939, which removed the last major obstacle to Germany\\'s invasion and occupation of western Poland, initiating World War II; and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the final stage of the war in August 1945.Janning, meanwhile, testifies for the prosecution, admitting he is guilty of condemning to death a Jewish man of \"blood defilement\" charges—namely, that the man had sex with a 16-year-old Gentile girl—when he knew there was no evidence to support such a verdict. Janning explains that well-meaning people like himself supported  Adolf Hitler\\'s anti-Semitic, racist policies out of patriotism even though they knew it was wrong, and that all of Germany bears some measure of responsibility for the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. \\nHaywood must weigh considerations of geopolitical expediency against his own ideals of justice. The trial is set against the background of the Berlin Blockade, and there is pressure to let the German defendants off lightly to gain German support in the growing Cold War against the Soviet Union.While the four defendants maintain their pleas of \"not guilty\" in their closing statements, Janning and fellow defendant Werner Lampe (Torben Meyer) show clear remorse for their actions, while a third, Friedrich Hofstetter (Martin Brandt) claims they had no choice but to execute the laws handed down by Hitler\\'s government. Only the fourth defendant, Emil Hahn (Werner Klemperer) remains unrepentant, telling the Americans that they will live to regret not allying with the Nazis against the Soviet Union. Ultimately, all four defendants are found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.\\nHaywood visits Janning in his cell. Janning affirms to Haywood that his verdict was a just one, but asks him to believe that, regarding the mass murder of innocents, he never knew that it would come to that. Judge Haywood replies it came to that the first time Janning condemned a man he knew to be innocent.\\nHaywood departs; a title card informs the audience that of 99 defendants sentenced to prison terms in Nuremberg trials that took place in the American Zone, none were still serving a sentence when the film was released in 1961.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Truman Show': 'Selected from birth and officially adopted by a television studio following an unwanted pregnancy, Truman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of The Truman Show, a reality television program filmed 24/7 through thousands of hidden cameras and broadcast worldwide. Christof, the show\\'s creator and executive producer, seeks to capture Truman\\'s authentic emotions and give audiences a relatable everyman.\\nTruman\\'s hometown, Seahaven Island, is set inside an enormous dome visible from space, populated by crew members and actors who advertise products both to Truman and the audience to generate revenue for the show. The elaborate set allows Christof to control almost every aspect of Truman\\'s life, including the weather. To prevent Truman from discovering the truth, Christof orchestrates scenarios that curtail his desire for exploration, such as the \"death\" of his father in a sea storm to instill thalassophobia, and constantly broadcasts messages about the dangers of traveling and the virtues of staying home.\\nDuring his college years, Truman, originally written to fall in love with and marry fellow student Meryl, instead develops feelings for Sylvia, an extra. Although Sylvia is fired from the show before she can disclose the truth to Truman, he secretly continues to dream of a life with her outside of his marriage to Meryl and hopes to travel to Fiji, where he is led to believe Sylvia moved. In the real world, Sylvia joins \"Free Truman\", an activist group that aims to cancel the show and have Truman released.\\nAs the show approaches its 30th anniversary, Truman gradually notices unusual occurrences around him, such as a broken spotlight falling from the clear sky, a column of rain falling only on him, a malfunctioning radio channel precisely describing his movements and the reappearance of his father (who is rushed away by crew members before Truman can confront him). Truman begins questioning his life and realizes that the city somehow revolves around him.\\nOne day, Truman takes Meryl on a surprise road trip. Still, increasingly implausible emergencies block their way, culminating in Truman suffering a nervous breakdown when a police officer who he does not know addresses him by name. At home, when Meryl attempts to advertise a product in a odd way, Truman deduces that she is involved in the conspiracy and holds her at knifepoint, demanding answers; she breaks character to call for help and is taken off the show. Hoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof reintroduces his father under the guise of his having developed amnesia after the boating accident. The show regains its ratings, and Truman seems to return to his routines. However, Christof soon notices Truman has been sleeping in his basement inactive for long hours. He sends Truman\\'s best friend Marlon to visit and discovers Truman secretly disappeared through a makeshift tunnel in his basement. Christof temporarily suspends the broadcast for the first time in its history, leading to record viewing numbers.\\nChristof orders a citywide search for Truman and is soon forced to break the production\\'s day-night cycle to optimize the search. Truman is found sailing away from Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water. Christof resumes the transmission and creates a violent storm in an attempt to capsize Truman\\'s boat. Truman nearly drowns, but his spirit remains unbroken, and he continues to sail until his boat strikes the wall of the dome.\\nInitially horrified, Truman looks around and finds a staircase leading to an exit door. As he contemplates leaving, Christof speaks to him directly through a speaker system, encouraging him to stay by claiming that there is no more truth in the real world than his artificial one, in which he has nothing to fear. After a moment of reflection, Truman utters his catchphrase: \"In case I don\\'t see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night\", bows to his audience, and exits.

Dragging himself from the pit, he takes a sample to an assay office and receives a silver and gold claim. In 1902, he discovers oil near Los Angeles and establishes a drilling company. Following the death of a worker in an accident, Daniel adopts the man\\'s orphaned son, H.W. The boy becomes his nominal business partner, allowing Daniel to present himself to potential investors as a family man.\\nIn 1911, Daniel is approached by Paul Sunday, a young man who tells him of an oil deposit under his family\\'s property in Little Boston, California. Daniel visits the Sundays\\' property and meets Paul\\'s identical twin brother Eli, a local preacher. Daniel attempts to purchase the farm from the Sundays at a bargain price under the ruse of using it to hunt quail, but his motives are questioned by Eli, who knows the land has drilling potential. In exchange for the property, Eli demands $10,000 for his church. An agreement is made and Daniel acquires all the available land in and around the Sunday property, save for one holdout, William Bandy, after Daniel neglected to negotiate with him.\\nAfter Daniel reneges on an agreement to let Eli bless the well before drilling begins, a series of misfortunes occur: an accident kills one worker and a gas blowout deafens H.W. and destroys the drilling infrastructure. Eli blames the disasters on the well not having been blessed. When Eli publicly demands the money still owed to him, Daniel beats and humiliates him. At the dinner table that night, Eli attacks and berates his father for having trusted Daniel. A man arrives at Daniel\\'s doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, Henry, and Daniel hires him. A jealous H.W. sets fire to their house, intending to kill Henry. Daniel sends H.W. to a school for the deaf in San Francisco. A Standard Oil representative offers to buy out Daniel\\'s local interests, but, after a perceived slight, Daniel refuses and instead strikes a deal with Union Oil to build a pipeline to the California coast. However, Bandy\\'s ranch remains an impediment.\\nDaniel becomes suspicious of Henry after he failed to recognize a local joke and confronts him one night at gunpoint. \"Henry\" confesses that he was a friend of the real Henry, who died of tuberculosis, and that he had impersonated Henry in the hope that Daniel could give him a job. Although the impostor promises to leave and never return, an enraged Daniel murders him and buries his body. Daniel drinks heavily and weeps. The next morning, Daniel is awakened by Bandy, who knows of Daniel\\'s crime and wants him to publicly repent in Eli\\'s church in exchange for an easement for the pipeline running across his land. As part of his baptism, Eli humiliates Daniel and coerces him into confessing that he abandoned his son. Later, while the pipeline is being built, H.W. reunites with Daniel, and Eli becomes a missionary.\\nIn 1927, H.W. marries Paul and Eli\\'s sister. Daniel, now extremely wealthy but a chronically embittered alcoholic, lives alone in a large mansion. H.W. asks his father to dissolve their partnership so that he can establish his own independent drilling company in Mexico. Daniel angrily mocks H.W.\\'s deafness before revealing his true origins. H.W. tells Daniel he is glad that they are not related and walks out with Daniel jeering at H.W. as he departs. While Daniel, drunk, is in his mansion\\'s private bowling alley, Eli, now a radio preacher, visits him. Eli offers to sell Daniel the Bandy ranch property rights, since Bandy has recently died. Daniel agrees on the condition that Eli denounce his faith and credibility. Once Eli acquiesces, Daniel coldly reveals that the property is now worthless, because his neighboring wells have already drained the same oil reservoir, comparing it to stealing a milkshake using a long straw. Desperate, Eli confesses to having lost money while speculating in the 1929 stock market crash and straying morally. Daniel taunts Eli, chases him around the bowling alley, and murders him with a bowling pin. When his butler appears to ask about the commotion, Daniel announces, \"I\\'m finished!\"\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Shutter Island': 'In 1954, U.S. Marshal Edward \"Teddy\" Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island, Boston Harbor to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando, a patient of the hospital who had previously drowned her three children.\\nThe staff, led by psychiatrist Dr. John Cawley, appear uncooperative. The marshals learn that Dr. Lester Sheehan, who was treating Solando, had left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. Teddy experiences migraine headaches, flashbacks of his experiences as a U.S. Army soldier during the liberation of Dachau, and also vivid dreams of his wife Dolores, who was killed in a fire set by arsonist Andrew Laeddis. Teddy explains to Chuck that he took the case to find Laeddis, believing he is on the island. Solando suddenly resurfaces and believes Teddy is her husband.  Teddy later breaks into the restricted Ward C to find Laeddis where he meets patient George Noyce who appears to know him well. He tells Teddy that the doctors are experimenting on patients, some of whom are taken to a lighthouse to be lobotomized. He warns Teddy that everyone is deceiving him and tells him not to trust Chuck.\\nTeddy regroups with Chuck and they climb the cliffs toward the lighthouse but become separated. Believing he saw Chuck\\'s body on the rocks below, Teddy climbs down but finds only a cave where a woman claiming to be the real Solando is hiding. She states that she is a former psychiatrist who discovered clandestine experiments to develop mind control but was forcibly committed. She says that Cawley and Dr. Naehring will use Teddy\\'s war trauma to feign a psychotic break, allowing them to have him also committed. Teddy returns to the hospital and is greeted by Cawley. When Teddy asks about Chuck\\'s whereabouts, Cawley firmly insists that Teddy does not have a partner and that he arrived on the island alone.\\nConvinced Chuck was taken to the lighthouse,  Teddy heads there but runs into Naehring, who attempts to sedate him. Teddy overpowers him and breaks into the lighthouse, only to discover Cawley waiting for him. Teddy confronts Cawley and reveals his encounter with Solando, saying he believes Cawley is experimenting on him. Cawley denies that Solando ever existed, and insists that Teddy has not been drugged, explaining the tremors as withdrawals from Chlorpromazine, a neuroleptic medication that Teddy has been taking for two years. Chuck arrives and reveals he is in fact, Dr. Sheehan. Cawley explains that \"Teddy\" is Andrew Laeddis, a U.S. Marshal incarcerated at Ashecliffe for murdering his manic depressive wife after she drowned their three children. Andrew did not seek treatment for Dolores when she burned down their apartment and instead moved his family to a lake house, where Dolores carried out the killings. Cawley explains that Andrew\\'s delusion is a result of his guilt, that his migraines and hallucinations are withdrawal symptoms, and that he had created the alternate persona of Edward Daniels, also a Marshal, who acted violently and espoused conspiracy theories about the facility. The \"investigation\" is an elaborate role-play to regain his true persona. Overwhelmed by his sudden recall, Andrew faints.\\nAwakening later, Andrew calmly recounts the truth, satisfying the doctors that he is lucid. Cawley notes that they had achieved this state nine months before, but that Andrew had quickly regressed. He warns that this will be Andrew\\'s last chance and if he lapses again he will be lobotomized due to his very violent conduct towards other patients such as Noyce, and towards the guards. Sometime later, Andrew relaxes on the hospital grounds with Sheehan. Appearing delusional, Andrew again refers to Sheehan as \"Chuck\" and says they must leave the island. Sheehan signals to Cawley, who orders that Andrew be lobotomized. Andrew then asks Sheehan if it would be worse \"to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?\" A stunned Sheehan calls Andrew \"Teddy\" but the latter does not respond and leaves peacefully with the orderlies for his operation.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', \"Pan's Labyrinth\": 'In a fairy tale, Princess Moanna, whose father is the king of the underworld, visits the human world, where the sunlight blinds her and erases her memory. She becomes mortal and eventually dies. The king believes that eventually, her spirit will return to the underworld, so he builds labyrinths, which act as portals, around the world in preparation for her return.\\nIn 1944 Francoist Spain, ten-year-old Ofelia travels with her pregnant mother Carmen to meet Captain Vidal, her new stepfather. Vidal believes strongly in Falangism and has been assigned to hunt down republican rebels. A large stick insect, which Ofelia believes to be a fairy, leads Ofelia into an ancient stone labyrinth, but she is stopped by Vidal\\'s housekeeper Mercedes, who is secretly supporting her brother Pedro and other rebels. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia\\'s bedroom, where it transforms into a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. There, she meets a faun, who believes she is the reincarnation of Princess Moanna. He gives her a book and tells her she will find in it three tasks to complete in order for her to acquire immortality and return to her kingdom.\\nOfelia completes the first task — retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad — but becomes worried about her mother, whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a mandrake root, instructing her to keep it under Carmen\\'s bed in a bowl of milk and regularly supply it with blood, which seems to ease Carmen\\'s illness. Accompanied by three fairy guides and equipped with a piece of magic chalk, Ofelia then completes the second task — retrieving a dagger from the lair of the Pale Man, a child-eating monster. Although warned not to consume anything there, she eats two grapes, awakening the Pale Man. He devours two of the fairies and chases Ofelia, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give Ofelia the third task.\\nDuring this time, Ofelia becomes aware of Vidal\\'s ruthlessness in the course of hunting down the rebels. After killing two local farmers detained on false suspicion of aiding the rebels, Vidal interrogates and tortures a captive rebel. He asks Doctor Ferreiro to tend to the captive, whom Ferreiro then euthanises at the rebel\\'s own urging. Realising that Ferreiro is a rebel collaborator, Vidal kills him. Vidal later catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root, which he considers delusional. Carmen agrees and throws the root into the fire. She immediately develops painful contractions and dies giving birth to Vidal\\'s son.\\nMercedes, having been discovered to be a spy, tries to escape with Ofelia, but they are caught. Ofelia is locked in her bedroom, while Mercedes is taken to be interrogated and tortured. Mercedes frees herself, and stabs Vidal non-lethally in her escape to re-join the rebels. The faun, having changed his mind about giving Ofelia a chance to perform the third task, returns and tells her to bring her newborn brother into the labyrinth to complete it. Ofelia successfully retrieves the baby and flees into the labyrinth. Vidal pursues her as the rebels launch an attack on the outpost. Ofelia meets the faun at the centre of the labyrinth.\\nThe faun suggests drawing a small amount of the baby\\'s blood, as completing the third task and opening the portal to the underworld requires the blood of an innocent, but Ofelia refuses to harm her brother. Vidal finds her talking to the faun, whom he cannot see. The faun leaves, and Vidal takes the baby from Ofelia\\'s arms before shooting her. Vidal returns to the labyrinth\\'s entrance, where he is surrounded by rebels, including Mercedes and Pedro. Knowing that he will be killed, he hands the baby to Mercedes, asking that his son be told the time of his father\\'s death. Mercedes replies that his son will not even know his name, before Pedro shoots Vidal dead.\\nMercedes enters the labyrinth and comforts a motionless, dying Ofelia. Drops of Ofelia\\'s blood fall down the centre of the spiral stone staircase onto an altar. Ofelia, well dressed and uninjured, then appears in a golden throne room. The King of the underworld tells her that, by choosing to spill her own blood rather than that of another, she passed the final test. The faun praises Ofelia for her choice, addressing her once more as \"Your Highness\". The Queen of the underworld, her mother, invites Ofelia to sit next to her father and rule at his side. Back in the stone labyrinth, Ofelia smiles as she dies.\\nThe epilogue completes the tale of Princess Moanna, stating that she returned to the Underworld, ruled with kindness and justice for many centuries, and left little traces of her time in the human realm, \"visible only to those who know where to look.\"\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Unforgiven': 'In 1880, in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, a cowboy—Quick Mike—slashes prostitute Delilah Fitzgerald\\'s face with a knife, permanently disfiguring her, after she laughs at his small penis. As punishment, sheriff \"Little Bill\" Daggett orders Mike and his associate who was with him at the brothel, Davey Bunting, to turn over several of their horses to her employer, Skinny DuBois, for his loss of revenue. Outraged, the prostitutes offer a $1,000 bounty for the cowboys\\' deaths.\\nIn Hodgeman County, Kansas, a boastful young man visits Will Munny\\'s hog farm. He calls himself the \"Schofield Kid\" and claims to be an experienced bounty hunter looking for help pursuing the cowboys. Formerly a notorious outlaw and murderer, Will is now a repentant widower raising two children. After initially refusing to help, Will realizes that his farm is failing and that his children\\'s future is in jeopardy. He recruits his friend Ned Logan, another retired outlaw, and they catch up with the Kid, who they discover is severely near-sighted.\\nBack in Big Whiskey, British-born gunfighter \"English\" Bob, an old acquaintance and rival of Little Bill, seeks the bounty. He arrives in town with his biographer W. W. Beauchamp, who naively believes Bob\\'s tall tales. Enforcing the town\\'s anti-gun law, Little Bill and his deputies disarm Bob, and the Sheriff beats him savagely to discourage others from attempting to claim the bounty. Little Bill humiliates Bob and banishes him from town the next morning, but Beauchamp stays out of a fascination with the Sheriff, who debunks many of the romantic notions Beauchamp has about the Wild West. Little Bill explains to Beauchamp that the best attribute for a gunslinger is to be cool-headed under fire rather than to have the quickest draw, and to always kill the best shooter first.\\nWill, Ned and the Kid arrive in town during a rainstorm and head to Skinny\\'s saloon. While Ned and the Kid meet with the prostitutes upstairs, Little Bill confronts a feverish Will. Not realizing Will\\'s identity but correctly guessing that he wants the bounty, Bill confiscates his pistol and beats him. Ned and the Kid escape through a back window and take Will to an unoccupied barn outside of town, where they and the prostitutes nurse him back to health. A few days later, the trio ambush Davey. After missing Davey and hitting his horse, Ned falters and Will shoots Davey instead. Ned decides to quit and sets off back to Kansas.\\nNed is later captured and flogged to death by Little Bill to learn the whereabouts of Will and the Kid. Will takes the Kid with him to the cowboys\\' ranch, directing him to ambush Quick Mike in the outhouse and shoot him. After they escape, a distraught Kid drunkenly confesses he had never killed anyone before and is overcome with remorse. A prostitute arrives with the reward and tells them about Ned\\'s fate. Shocked by the news, Will begins drinking and demands the Kid\\'s revolver. The Kid hands it over, saying that he no longer wants to be a killer, and Will sends him back to Kansas to distribute the reward.\\nThat night, Will finds Ned\\'s corpse displayed in a coffin outside Skinny\\'s saloon as a warning to bounty hunters. Inside, Little Bill and his deputies are organizing a posse. Will walks in alone, brandishing a shotgun and kills Skinny for displaying Ned\\'s corpse. He then takes aim at Little Bill, only for the shotgun to misfire. In the ensuing gunfight, Will shoots Little Bill and four deputies with the revolver. He then orders the rest of the posse out. Beauchamp lingers briefly to ask how Will survived; Will replies that it was luck and scares him away. Little Bill tries and fails to take another shot while lying on the floor, then bemoans his fate and curses Will, who shoots him dead. Will shouts threats as he mounts his horse and rides out of town.\\nA closing title card states that Will\\'s mother-in-law found his farm abandoned years later, Will having possibly moved to San Francisco with the children, where he prospered in dry goods, and she remained at a loss to understand why her daughter married such a notorious outlaw and murderer.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Sixth Sense': \"While Philadelphia-based child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is home with his wife, Anna, Vincent Grey, a former patient Malcolm had treated, breaks into their house.

He feels he must help Cole to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with Anna, who has become distant and cold and is suffering from depression. Cole's mother Lynn worries about him, especially after seeing mysterious signs of physical harm. At a birthday party, when bullies see that Cole is terribly scared of a cupboard, they lock him in there, causing him to scream in terror about someone seemingly inside with him. Following this, Cole finally confides to Malcolm that he sees dead people who walk around like the living do, unaware that they are dead.\\nMalcolm thinks Cole is schizophrenic and considers dropping his case. However, after listening to an audiotape from a session with Vincent, he hears a man begging for help in Spanish when Vincent is supposed to be alone in the room, suggesting that Vincent had the same ability. He realizes that Cole is telling the truth and suggests that he try to communicate with the ghosts and help them finish their business.\\nOne night, Cole discovers Kyra Collins, a female child ghost, vomiting. He finds out who she is and goes with Malcolm to the funeral reception at her home. In her room, Kyra gives Cole a videotape that he hands to her father. The tape reveals Kyra's mother poisoning her food, alerting her father to the reality of her death and saving her younger sister from the same fate.\\nNow that Cole is doing better socially and personally, he tries out for and is given a lead part in the school play.

After a Velociraptor kills a dinosaur handler, the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand a safety certification. Gennaro invites chaotician Ian Malcolm, and Hammond invites paleontologist Alan Grant and paleobotanist Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live Brachiosaurus and a whole herd of other dinosaurs.\\nAt the park's visitor center, the group learns that the cloning was accomplished by extracting dinosaur DNA from prehistoric mosquitoes preserved in amber. DNA from frogs, among other animals, was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaurs' genome. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female by direct chromosome manipulation. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby Velociraptor and visits the raptor enclosure. During lunch, the group debates the ethics of cloning and the park's creation. Malcolm warns of the implications of genetic engineering and scoffs at the park's design, saying it will inevitably break down.\\nHammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim, join for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees from the control room. The tour does not go as planned, with most of the dinosaurs failing to appear and the group encountering a sick Triceratops. The tour is cut short as a tropical storm approaches. Most of the park employees leave for the mainland on a boat, while the visitors return to their railed-electric tour vehicles, except Sattler, who stays behind with the park's veterinarian, Dr. Harding, to study the sick Triceratops.\\nJurassic Park's disgruntled lead computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has been bribed by Dodgson, a man working for Hammond's corporate rival, to steal frozen dinosaur embryos. Nedry deactivates the park's security system to access the embryo storage room and stores the embryos inside a container disguised as a Barbasol shaving cream can. Nedry's sabotage also cuts power to the tour vehicles, stranding them just as they near the park's Tyrannosaurus rex paddock. Most of the park's electric fences have also been deactivated, allowing the Tyrannosaurus to escape and attack the group. After the Tyrannosaurus overturns a tour vehicle, it injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro, while Grant, Lex, and Tim escape. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry gets lost in the rain, crashes his Jeep Wrangler, and is killed by a venom-spitting Dilophosaurus.\\nSattler helps the game warden, Robert Muldoon, search for survivors; they find an injured Malcolm just before the Tyrannosaurus returns and chases them away. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop and encounter a Brachiosaurus herd. They discover the broken shells of dinosaur eggs the following morning. Grant concludes that the dinosaurs have been breeding, which was possible because of amphibian DNA—animals like West African frogs can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well. The three later encounter a  Gallimimus stampede.\\nUnable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and chief engineer Ray Arnold reboot the park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When he fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the Velociraptors. Muldoon distracts the raptors while Sattler goes to turn the power back on before being attacked by a raptor and discovering Arnold's severed arm. Meanwhile, Muldoon is caught off guard and killed by the other two raptors.\\nGrant, Tim, and Lex reach the visitor center. Grant heads out to look for Sattler, leaving Tim and Lex inside. The raptors pursue Tim and Lex in a kitchen, but they escape, managing to lock one in a freezer and join Grant and Sattler. The group reaches the control room and Lex uses Nedry's computer to restore the park's power, allowing them to call Hammond, who calls for help. As they try to escape by the main entrance, they are cornered by the two remaining raptors, but they escape when the Tyrannosaurus appears and kills them. Hammond arrives in a jeep with Malcolm, and the group boards a helicopter to leave the island.\\n\\n\\n== Cast\", 'A Beautiful Mind': 'In 1947, John Nash arrives at Princeton University as a co-recipient, with Martin Hansen, of the Carnegie Scholarship for Mathematics.

Carla Jean is approached by Sheriff Bell, who promises to protect Moss. Carla Jean\\'s mother unknowingly reveals Moss\\' location to a group of Mexicans tailing them. Bell reaches the motel rendezvous at El Paso, only to hear gunshots and spot a pickup truck speeding from the motel. Bell finds Moss dead in his motel room. Carla Jean arrives later and understands from Bell\\'s expression that Llewelyn is dead.\\nThat night, Bell returns to the crime scene and observes the lock blown out. Chigurh appears to hide behind the door of the room, but when Bell hesitantly enters, he finds the room empty. He sees the vent cover removed. Later, Bell visits his uncle Ellis, an ex-lawman, and tells him he plans to retire because he feels \"overmatched\" by the recent violence. Ellis tells Bell of a story in which a lawman, Bell\\'s great uncle, was killed on his own porch, and says that the region has always been violent.\\nWeeks later, Carla Jean returns from her mother\\'s funeral to find Chigurh waiting in her bedroom. She refuses his offer of a coin toss for her life, stating that he cannot pass blame to luck: the choice is his.  Chigurh checks his boots as he leaves the house. As he drives through the neighborhood, he is injured in a car crash at an intersection, but survives. He then bribes two young witnesses for a clean shirt and their silence and flees.\\nNow retired, Bell shares two dreams with his wife. In the first, he lost some money his father had given him. In the other, he and his father were riding through a snowy mountain pass; his father had gone ahead to make a fire in the darkness and wait for Bell.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail': 'In AD 932, King Arthur and his squire, Patsy, travel Britain searching for men to join the Knights of the Round Table. Along the way, Arthur debates whether swallows could carry coconuts, passes through a town infected with the Black Death, recounts receiving Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake to two anarcho-syndicalist peasants, defeats the Black Knight, and observes an impromptu witch trial. He recruits Sir Bedevere the Wise, Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Galahad the Pure, Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, and the aptly named Sir Not-Appearing-in-this-Film, along with their squires and Robin\\'s minstrels. Arthur leads the knights to Camelot, but, after a musical number, changes his mind, deeming it \"a silly place\". As they turn away, God appears and orders Arthur to find the Holy Grail.\\nArthur and his knights arrive at a castle occupied by French soldiers, who claim to have the Grail and taunt the Britons, driving them back with a barrage of barnyard animals. Bedevere concocts a plan to sneak in using a Trojan Rabbit, but no one hides inside it, and the Britons are forced to flee when it is flung back at them. Arthur decides the knights should go their separate ways to search for the Grail. \\nA modern-day historian filming a documentary on the Arthurian legends is killed by an unknown knight on horseback, triggering a police investigation.\\nArthur and Bedevere are given directions by an old man and attempt to satisfy the strange requests of the dreaded Knights Who Say \"Ni!\" Sir Robin avoids a fight with a Three-Headed Knight by running away while the heads are arguing among themselves. Sir Galahad is led by a grail-shaped beacon to Castle Anthrax, which is occupied exclusively by young women, who wish to be punished for misleading him, but he is unwillingly \"rescued\" by Lancelot. Lancelot receives an arrow-shot note from Swamp Castle. Believing the note is from a lady being forced to marry against her will, he storms the castle and slaughters several members of the wedding party, only to discover the note is from an effeminate prince.\\nArthur and his knights regroup and are joined by Brother Maynard, his monk brethren, and three new knights: Bors, Gawain and Ector. They meet Tim the Enchanter, who directs them to a cave where the location of the Grail is said to be written. The entrance to the cave is guarded by the Rabbit of Caerbannog. Underestimating it, the knights attack, but the Rabbit easily kills Bors, Gawain and Ector. Arthur uses the \"Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch\", provided by Brother Maynard, to destroy the creature. Inside the cave, they find an inscription from Joseph of Arimathea, directing them to Castle Aarrgh.\\nA cave monster devours Brother Maynard, but Arthur and the knights escape after the animator unexpectedly suffers a fatal heart attack. The knights approach the Bridge of Death, where the bridge-keeper demands they answer three questions in order to pass or else be cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. Lancelot easily answers simple questions and crosses. An overly cocky Robin is defeated by an unexpectedly difficult question, and an indecisive Galahad fails an easy one; both are magically flung into the gorge. When Arthur asks for clarification on a question regarding the airspeed of an unladen swallow, the bridge-keeper cannot answer and is himself thrown into the gorge.\\nArthur and Bedevere cannot find Lancelot, unaware that he has been arrested by police investigating the historian\\'s death. The pair reach Castle Aarrgh, but find it occupied by the French soldiers from earlier in the film. After being repelled by showers of manure, they summon an army of knights and prepare to assault the castle. As the army charges, the police arrive, arrest Arthur and Bedevere for the murder of the historian and break the camera, abruptly ending the film.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1': \"In 1999, the Bride, a former member of the Deadly Viper assassination squad, is rehearsing her marriage at a chapel in El Paso, Texas. The Deadly Vipers, led by Bill, attack the chapel, shooting everyone. As the Bride lies wounded, she tells Bill he is the father of her unborn child, just as he shoots her in the head. \\nThe Bride falls into a coma. In the hospital, Elle Driver, one of the Deadly Vipers, prepares to assassinate her via lethal injection. Bill aborts the mission, considering it dishonorable to kill her while she is defenseless. The Bride awakens after four years and is horrified to discover she is no longer pregnant. She kills a man who intends to rape her and a hospital worker who has been selling her body while she was comatose. She takes the hospital worker's truck and gets herself back in shape, vowing to kill Bill and the other Deadly Vipers.\\nThe Bride goes to the home of Vernita Green, a former Deadly Viper who now leads a normal suburban life. She and the Bride engage in a knife fight, which is interrupted when Vernita's young daughter arrives home. When Vernita tries to shoot the Bride with a pistol hidden in a box of cereal, the Bride throws a knife into her chest, killing her.\\nThe Bride goes to Okinawa to obtain a sword from the legendary swordsmith Hattori Hanzō, who has sworn never to forge a sword again.

He warns British Group Captain Ramsey—the highest-ranked POW officer and their de facto leader—that any man who escapes will be shot.\\nRegardless, many of the men try as soon as arriving, though none make it past the fence. USAAF Captain Hilts, a notoriously prolific escapee, spots a blind spot between two guard towers—however, he purposefully gets caught before the guards can realize his discovery. He is sentenced to solitary isolation (“the cooler”) with RAF airman Ives, whom he befriends.\\nRAF Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett re-establishes \"the X Organisation\", the escape-planning committee at their former camp, with Ramsey\\'s tacit approval. He argues that the best way to help the Allied forces is to break out 250 men simultaneously, forcing the Germans to divert significant manpower away from the front. The POWs begin working on three tunnels: \"Tom\", \"Dick\", and \"Harry\".\\nEach POW brings something to the plan. Hendley secures vital objects on the black market, and forms a bond with Blythe, an expert forger. Sedgwick makes picks and air bellows, while Welinski and Dickes oversee the digging. MacDonald gathers intelligence, Griffith sews civilian disguises, and Ashley-Pitt devises a method of hiding the excavated dirt. Digging noise is masked by a choir, led by Cavendish, who also surveys the tunnels\\' routes.\\nAware that Hilts was planning to use the blind spot to jump the fence, Bartlett asks him to instead help the X Organisation by escaping, scouting out the surrounding area, and then allowing himself to be recaptured so he can draw maps for the main breakout. Hilts refuses out of pride.\\nWhen \"Tom\" nears completion first, Bartlett orders \"Dick\" and \"Harry\" sealed off. Hilts, Hendley, and Goff brew potato moonshine with a homemade still and celebrate the Fourth of July with the entire camp, but to the POWs\\' dismay the guards accidently find \"Tom\". A despondent Ives snaps, frantically climbs the barbed wire fence, and is shot dead. Hilts, shaken, agrees to Bartlett\\'s proposal.\\nBartlett switches the prisoners\\' efforts to \"Harry\". When the tunnel partially collapses, Welinski has a breakdown and confides to Dickes that he is claustrophobic. He tries to break out through the fence, but Dickes manages to calm him down and prevent him being shot like Ives. Blythe finds he is going blind due to progressive myopia, and Hendley takes it upon himself to be Blythe\\'s eyes during the escape.\\nThe last part of the tunnel is soon completed, but when they break the surface on the night of the escape, the end is found to be 20 feet short of their intended endpoint among trees, and within sight of the guards. Guided by Hilts using a tug on a rope as a signal— and aided by a fortuitous air raid blackout— multiple POWs flee before Cavendish slips and makes a noise. An impatient Griffith surfaces while a guard investigates and is captured, ending the breakout.\\nThe 76 escapees flee throughout Europe. Three make it to freedom: Welinski and Dickes row to a port and board a ship for Sweden, while Sedgwick makes it to France, where the Resistance smuggles him to Spain. The rest are unsuccessful: Cavendish hitches a ride on a truck, but is turned in by the driver. Hilts steals a motorcycle and heads for the German-Swiss border, chased by soldiers. He successfully jumps one line of barbed-wire-topped tank barriers, but the bike is shot at a second, and he becomes entangled in wire and is recaptured. Hendley and Blythe steal a Luftwaffe training plane to fly to Switzerland, but crash when the engine fails 20 minutes before arriving; Blythe is shot and Hendley recaptured. At a railway station, Kuhn, a Gestapo guard from the camp, is with the authorities searching the disembarking passengers for escapees. Ashley-Pitt kills Kuhn to prevent him recognizing Bartlett and is shot dead. However, Bartlett and MacDonald are still caught when another Gestapo officer tricks MacDonald into speaking English while boarding a bus.\\nMost of the men are loaded into trucks, but instead of returning to the camp are taken to a field and shot dead on Hitler\\'s direct orders. An ashamed von Luger tells Ramsey that 50 were killed; a broken Hendley asks Ramsey if the escape was worth it. Von Luger is relieved of command, and as he is being brought to a car to be driven to an uncertain fate, he comes face-to-face with Hilts, who has just been brought back to camp. The now-former Kommandant tells Hilts that it looks like he [Hilts] will be the one to see Berlin first. Hilts is sent to the cooler, where he begins planning his next escape.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Thing': 'In the winter of 1982, an alien spacecraft and a nearby alien body are discovered buried in Antarctic ice by members of the Norwegian research station \"Thule\". American paleontologist Kate Lloyd is recruited by Dr. Sander Halvorson and assistant Adam Finch to investigate. They fly to Thule in a helicopter with pilots Sam Carter and Derek Jameson, and crewman Griggs. They meet station chief Edvard Wolner, along with his team of Juliette, Olav, Karl, Jonas, Henrik, Colin, Peder, Lars, and Lars\\' dog.\\nThe body is excavated in a block of ice and returned to the Thule Station. During a party, Jameson sees the alien burst from the ice block. Searching for the alien, the team finds Lars\\' dog dead. The alien drags Henrik into itself, spattering blood on Olav. The group kills the alien by igniting spilled fuel beneath it. An autopsy reveals that the alien\\'s cells were copying Henrik\\'s. Olav falls ill.\\nAs Carter, Jameson, and Griggs are taking off in the helicopter to take Olav to a medical facility, Griggs transforms into a monstrous creature and attacks Olav, causing the helicopter to crash in the mountains. Kate discovers dental fillings in a bloodied shower and tells the team that the alien can assimilate and imitate its victims and that it is now living among them. Edvard orders the team to drive to the closest base; however, Juliette and Kate want to prevent anyone from leaving. Juliette lures Kate into an abandoned room before transforming and attacking her. Kate escapes and the Juliette-Thing kills Karl. Lars kills the Juliette-Thing using a flamethrower and the team resolve to quarantine themselves until the threat is eliminated.\\nThat night, Carter and Jameson stagger back from the crashed helicopter. Suspected to be alien, they are imprisoned in isolation. As the alien does not assimilate inorganic material, Kate proposes everyone be checked for dental fillings. The test implicates Sander, Edvard, Adam, and Colin, who have no metallic fillings.\\nLars is abducted while going to fetch Carter and Jameson for testing. Carter and Jameson break into the main building, shooting Peder dead and puncturing his flamethrower tank, causing an explosion and knocking Edvard unconscious. When brought to the main room, Edvard violently transforms, infects Jonas and Jameson, and assimilates Adam. Kate burns Jonas and Jameson before they can fully transform, then she and Carter burn the Edvard-Adam-Thing before pursuing Sander, who had been assimilated.\\nThe Sander-Thing drives off into the night in a snowcat pursued by Kate and Carter. The spacecraft suddenly activates, separating them. Kate falls into the ship and confronts the monstrous Sander. She kills him with a grenade which shuts down the ship\\'s engines. Kate finds Carter and notices he is missing his earring. Carter indicates the wrong ear so Kate burns the Carter-Thing and moves to the second snowcat before driving away.\\nThe next morning, Thule\\'s helicopter and pilot Matias return. Matias views the ruined station and the husk of the Edvard-Adam-Thing with horror. Colin has committed suicide with a straight razor in the radio comms room, and Lars demands at gunpoint that Matias show his teeth. Lars\\' dog, thought dead, emerges and runs away. Realizing that the dog is a Thing, Lars orders Matias to give chase in the helicopter.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Rashomon': \"In Heian-era Kyoto, a woodcutter and a priest, taking shelter from a downpour under the Rashōmon city gate, recount a story of a recent assault and murder. Baffled at the existence of several conflicting accounts of the same event, the woodcutter and the priest are joined by a commoner. The woodcutter claims he had found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier, alongside the samurai's cap, his wife's hat, cut pieces of rope, and an amulet. The priest claims he had seen the samurai travel with his wife on the day of the murder. Both testify in court before a policeman presents the main suspect, a captured bandit named Tajōmaru.\\nTajōmaru testifies that he had followed the couple after spotting them traveling in the woods. He claims to have tricked the samurai into leaving the trail by lying about finding a burial pit filled with ancient artifacts. He then subdued the samurai and attempted to rape his wife, who initially tries to defend herself with a dagger. Tajōmaru then seduces her; the wife, ashamed of the dishonor of having been with two men, asks Tajōmaru to duel her husband so she may go with the man who wins. Tajōmaru agrees; the duel is fierce, and Tajōmaru claims to have killed the samurai only to find the wife had fled. At the end of his testimony, Tajōmaru states he had forgotten the wife's dagger, lamenting its loss. The priest notes that men lie even to themselves because they are weak.\\nThe wife, having been found by the police, delivers different testimony; she claimed that Tajōmaru did assault her but afterwards left immediately. She freed her husband from his bonds, but he stared at her with contempt and loathing. The wife tried to threaten him with her dagger but then fainted from panic. She awoke to find her husband dead, having committed suicide with the dagger. In shock, she wandered through the forest until she came upon a pond. She attempted to drown herself but failed. The commoner notes that women use their tears to hide lies and end up fooling themselves.\\nThe samurai's testimony is heard through a medium. He claimed that after the assault, Tajōmaru asked the wife to marry him. To the samurai's shame, she accepts, asking Tajōmaru to kill the samurai first. This disgusted Tajōmaru, who then gave the samurai the choice to let her go or have her killed. Through the medium, the samurai expresses approval for this gesture. The wife then broke free and fled, and Tajōmaru unsuccessfully gave chase. After being set free by an apologetic Tajōmaru, the samurai states he killed himself with the dagger. Later, he felt someone remove the dagger from his chest, but could not tell who.\\nThe woodcutter fiercely proclaims that all three stories are falsehoods and admits that he saw the samurai killed by a sword instead of a dagger. The commoner pressures the woodcutter to admit that he had seen the murder but lied to avoid getting in trouble. According to the woodcutter, Tajōmaru begged the wife to marry him. She instead freed her husband, expecting him to kill Tajōmaru. The samurai refused to fight, explaining that he would not risk his life for a ruined woman. Tajōmaru rescinded his promise to marry the wife; the wife rebukes them both for failing to keep their promises. The two men unwillingly enter into a feeble duel; the samurai is disarmed and begs for his life, and Tajōmaru kills him. The woodcutter ends his account by stating that the wife fled afterwards, and that Tajōmaru stole the samurai's sword and limped away.\\nThe woodcutter, the priest and the commoner are interrupted by the sound of a crying baby. They find a child abandoned in a basket along with a kimono and an amulet; the commoner steals the items, for which he is rebuked by the woodcutter. The commoner deduces that the woodcutter had lied not because he feared getting in trouble, but because he had stolen the wife's dagger to sell for food. He leaves, claiming that all men and women are motivated only by self-interest.\\nMeanwhile, the priest has been attempting to soothe the baby. The woodcutter attempts to take the child after the commoner's departure; the priest, having lost his faith in humanity after the events of the trial and the commoner's actions, strongly recoils. The woodcutter explains that he intends to raise the child. Having seen the woodcutter's true and well-meaning intentions, the priest tells him that his faith in men has been restored. As the woodcutter prepares to leave, the rain stops and the clouds part, revealing the sun.\\n\\n\\n== Cast\", 'Finding Nemo': 'Clownfish Marlin lives in an anemone in the Great Barrier Reef with his partner, Coral. The couple are awaiting for their many eggs to hatch. A hungry barracuda sees Coral and Marlin, with the rest of their neighbourhood hiding.

One egg remains uneaten, with it being slightly cracked. Marlin vows to keep his only surviving child safe. Marlin becomes overprotective of his son, Nemo. While Marlin talks to Nemo\\'s teacher on the latter\\'s first day of school, Nemo approaches a speedboat, where a pair of scuba divers capture him. Marlin pursues the boat in vain and meets Dory, a blue tang with acute short-term memory loss, who offers her help. The two encounter Bruce, Anchor, and Chum, three sharks who have sworn to abstain from eating fish. Marlin finds a diver\\'s mask that fell from the boat, accidentally hitting Dory and giving her a nosebleed. The scent of her blood sends Bruce into a feeding frenzy, but the sharks flee after accidentally setting off old naval mines, which knock Marlin and Dory unconscious.\\nNemo is placed in a Fish Tank in the office of dentist Philip Sherman in Sydney. He meets the \"Tank Gang\" led by Gill, a Moorish idol. The Tank Gang tells Nemo that he will be given to Sherman\\'s niece, Darla, who killed her previous fish. Gill decides to help Nemo and devises an escape plan: Nemo can fit inside the aquarium\\'s filter tube and must block it with a pebble, obliging Sherman to put the fish into plastic bags while he cleans the tank. This will allow them to roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to place the pebble, but fails and is almost killed.\\nMarlin and Dory awaken, but the mask falls into a deep trench. Descending after the mask, they are soon pursued by an anglerfish. Dory memorizes the address on the goggles, and they escape. The two disregard directions from a school of moonfish, taking what Marlin believes is a safer route. After being stung by a forest of jellyfish, they are knocked unconscious and awaken in the East Australian Current with a group of sea turtles, including Crush and his son, Squirt. The story of Marlin\\'s quest is relayed across the ocean to Sydney, where a pelican named Nigel tells the Tank Gang. Nemo then successfully blocks the filter, and soon, the aquarium is covered in green algae.\\nMarlin and Dory exit the East Australian Current and are consumed by a blue whale which expels them through its blowhole into Sydney Harbour. Nigel helps them escape a flock of seagulls and takes them to the dentist\\'s office, where Sherman has foiled the Tank Gang with a new high-tech filter. When Darla arrives, Nemo plays dead, and Nigel terrifies Darla, throwing the office into chaos. Sherman throws out Nigel along with Marlin and Dory, with the former believing that Nemo is dead. Gill helps Nemo escape through a drain leading to the ocean.\\nMarlin bids farewell to Nigel and Dory and begins his journey home. Nemo meets Dory, but she does not remember him until her memory returns when she reads the word \"Sydney\" on a drainpipe. Dory reunites Nemo with Marlin, but a fishing trawler captures her in a net along with a school of groupers. With his father\\'s blessing, Nemo enters the net, and he and Marlin instruct the fish to swim down. Their combined force breaks the net. Returning home to the reef, Marlin is more confident, while Dory has remained friends with Bruce, Anchor, and Chum. Marlin and Dory watch Nemo off as he goes to school. Meanwhile, after the dentist\\'s filter breaks,  the Tank Gang escapes into Sydney Harbour after being placed in bags. Still stuck in the bags, they ponder what to do next.\\n\\n\\n== Voice cast', 'The Elephant Man': 'Frederick Treves, a surgeon at the London Hospital, finds John Merrick in a Victorian freak show in London\\'s East End, where he is kept by Mr. Bytes, the brutish ringmaster.

She refuses to say who hired her, but tells Gittes to check that day\\'s obituaries.\\nGittes learns that Mulwray was once the business partner of Evelyn\\'s wealthy father, Noah Cross. At his club, Cross offers to double Gittes\\'s fee if he searches for Mulwray\\'s missing mistress. At the hall of records, Gittes discovers that much of the Northwest Valley has recently changed ownership. He visits an orange grove in the valley but is attacked by landowners who believe him to be an agent of the Water Department, which is sabotaging the water supply to force them out.\\nThe Water Department is drying up the land so it can be bought cheaply, and Mulwray was murdered when he uncovered the plan. Some of the property in the valley was seemingly purchased by a recently deceased retirement home resident.

Gittes gets violent with Evelyn until she breaks down and reveals that Katherine is her sister and daughter. Evelyn\\'s father raped her when she was 15 years old, and she ran away to Mexico.

When Strange refuses, Peter steals the spell, traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and, with May, takes the villains to Happy Hogan\\'s apartment, where he uses Stark Industries technology to cure Octavius. \\nBefore Peter can cure anyone else, his spider-sense goes off. He then realizes that the Goblin persona has retaken control of Osborn, who convinces the uncured villains to betray Peter. As Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape, the Goblin fatally injures May. Before she dies, May tells Peter that \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\".\\nNed discovers that he can create portals using Strange\\'s sling ring, which he and MJ use to try to locate Peter. They instead find alternate versions of Peter from the villains\\' universes who were also summoned by Strange\\'s spell and who are nicknamed \"Peter-Two\" and \"Peter-Three\". The group finds this universe\\'s Peter, nicknamed \"Peter-One\", who is ready to give up and send the villains home to die. The alternate Peters share stories of losing loved ones and encourage Peter-One to fight in May\\'s honor, and the three Peters develop cures for the villains.\\nThe group lure Dillon, Marko, and Connors to the Statue of Liberty. Peter-One and Peter-Two cure Connors and Marko, while Octavius arrives to help cure Dillon, and Ned frees Strange from the Mirror Dimension. The Goblin appears and unleashes the contained spell, which breaks apart the barriers between universes, pulling in countless others who know Parker\\'s identity. \\nStrange attempts to hold them off while an enraged Peter-One tries to kill the Goblin. Peter-Two stops him, but gets stabbed by the Goblin. Peter-Three helps Peter-One inject the Goblin with his cure, restoring Osborn\\'s sanity. Peter-One realizes that the only way to protect the multiverse is to erase himself from everyone\\'s memory and requests Strange to do so, while promising MJ and Ned that he will find them again. Strange reluctantly casts the spell, and everyone returns to their respective universes—including Eddie Brock, who unknowingly leaves behind a piece of the Venom symbiote.\\nTwo weeks later, Peter visits MJ to reintroduce himself to her and Ned, but he decides against it. While mourning at May\\'s grave, he has a conversation with Hogan and is inspired to carry on, making a new suit and resuming his vigilantism.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'V for Vendetta': 'In the near future, Britain is ruled by the Norsefire political party, a fascist and authoritarian regime led by High Chancellor Adam Sutler, which controls the populace through propaganda, and imprisons or executes those deemed undesirable, including immigrants, homosexuals, and people of alternative religions.\\nEvey Hammond is the daughter of parents who became activists after her brother perished in the St Mary\\'s school terrorist attack fourteen years earlier; they were detained when she was 12 years old and later died in prison. One evening, a Guy Fawkes masked vigilante, \"V\", rescues her from assault by the secret police and has her witness his destruction of the Old Bailey via bombs. The following morning, on 5 November, V hijacks the state-run television network to address the nation, claiming credit for the attack and encouraging the populace to resist Norsefire by joining him outside the Houses of Parliament on Guy Fawkes Night in one year\\'s time. Evey is knocked unconscious while aiding V\\'s escape, and he takes her with him to avoid her arrest and likely execution.\\nV kills Norsefire propagandist Lewis Prothero, Dr. Delia Surridge, and, with Evey\\'s assistance, Anthony Lilliman, the Bishop of London. Evey flees after betraying V, hoping to be forgiven by Norsefire. Assigned to capture V, Chief Inspector Eric Finch uses Surridge\\'s journal and information from former covert operative William Rookwood (actually V in disguise), discovering that, two decades earlier, Surridge led biological weapon research and human experimentation at the Larkhill Detention Facility on behalf of Norsefire, creating the \"St Mary\\'s Virus\". Although dozens of political prisoners died during experimentation, an amnesiac in cell \"V\" developed mutated immunities and disfigurements as well as physical enhancements and eventually destroyed Larkhill during his escape. Peter Creedy, head of the secret police, faked a terrorist attack by releasing the virus at targets including St. Mary\\'s and used the resulting public fear to embed Norsefire in power. Simultaneously, the company manufacturing the cure enriched party members such as Prothero and Lilliman.\\nEvey takes shelter with her former boss, talkshow host Gordon Dietrich, who shows her his collection of illegal materials such as subversive paintings, an antique Quran, and homoerotic photographs. Emboldened by Evey and V, he satirizes Sutler on his show, leading to his and Evey\\'s arrest and his eventual execution. She takes solace in a note hidden in her cell written by Valerie Page, a woman imprisoned in the cell next to V\\'s, detailing her hopes despite her impending death. Tortured and facing her own execution, Evey refuses to submit to her captors and is released, finding herself in V\\'s lair. V had intercepted Evey before Creedy\\'s men and subjected her to false imprisonment (and gaslighting) so she could learn to live without fear. Although initially angry at V, Evey realizes that he has been avenging Valerie and the other Larkhill victims and promises to return to see him before 5 November. To kill the otherwise unreachable High Chancellor, V convinces Creedy to betray Sutler and replace him in exchange for V\\'s surrender.\\nAs 5 November approaches, V has hundreds of thousands of Guy Fawkes masks distributed across the nation, leading to a rise in masked, anonymous chaos and eventually riots after the secret police kill a young masked girl. V shares a dance with Evey before leading her to the shuttered London underground he restored over the previous decade. Not intending to survive the night, V bequeaths the decision to start the explosive-filled train to Evey. Although she pleads that he abandon his crusade and leave with her, he refuses. Creedy meets V and executes Sutler before demanding V unmask. Despite being shot and heavily injured, V kills Creedy and his men, stating that the idea he represents is more important than his identity. V returns to Evey, dying in her arms after admitting he loves her, and Finch finds her placing V\\'s body aboard the train but allows her to start it after she affirms that the people need hope. With Sutler and Creedy dead, the military forces in London stand down as countless citizens dressed as V descend on Parliament and witness its destruction. Finch asks for V\\'s true identity, to which Evey replies, \"He was all of us\".\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Gone with the Wind': \"In 1861, on the eve of the American Civil War, Scarlett O'Hara lives at Tara, her family's cotton plantation in Georgia, with her parents, two sisters, and their many black slaves.

Jake\\'s brother Joey discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts, but he repeatedly refuses the Mafia\\'s help, wanting to win the championship on his own terms. Some time after, Jake spots a fifteen-year-old girl named Vickie at a swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, although he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite Jake dominating Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson, who Joey feels won only because he was enlisting into the Army the following week. By 1945, Jake marries Vickie.\\nJake is controlling and domineering over Vickie, and constantly worries that she has feelings for other men. His jealousy is evident when he brutally beats his next opponent, Tony Janiro, in front of Tommy Como, the local mob boss, and Vickie. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vickie, who implies she is dissatisfied in her marriage with Jake. Under the impression that Vickie is having an affair with Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. Jake purposely loses his next match against Billy Fox, and is booed out of the building after putting up a lackluster performance. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, much to his anguish. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the middleweight championship title against Marcel Cerdan.\\nA year later, Jake becomes increasingly paranoid that Vickie is having an affair. He asks Joey if he has had an affair with her, enraging Joey and causing him to leave. Jake later presses Vickie about whether she has had an affair, leading to her sarcastically confessing that she had sex with Joey, Salvy and Tommy. In a fit of rage, Jake, followed by Vickie, walks to Joey\\'s house and assaults him in front of his wife Lenora and their children before knocking Vickie unconscious. Vickie later returns to their home and threatens to leave, but they reconcile. After defending his championship belt in a grueling fifteen-round bout against Laurent Dauthuille in 1950, he calls his brother after the fight to make amends, but when Joey assumes Salvy is on the other end and starts insulting and cursing at him, Jake silently hangs up. Estranged from his brother, Jake\\'s career begins to decline and he eventually loses his title to Sugar Ray Robinson in their final encounter in 1951.\\nBy 1956, an aged and overweight Jake has retired and moved with his family to Miami. After he stays out all night at the nightclub which he owns, Vickie tells him she wants a divorce as well as full custody of their children. She also threatens to call the police if he comes anywhere near them. He is later arrested for introducing under-age girls to men in his club. He unsuccessfully attempts to bribe his way out of his criminal case using the jewels from his championship belt. In 1957, he goes to jail, sorrowfully questioning his misfortune and crying in despair. Upon returning to New York City in 1958, he encounters Joey, who reluctantly accepts his embrace.\\nIn 1964, Jake performs stand-up comedy at various clubs. Backstage before a show, LaMotta prepares himself for his performance, shadowboxing and chanting \"I\\'m the boss\" before taking the stage.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Dial M for Murder': 'In the mid-1950s, Tony Wendice, a retired English professional tennis player, is married to wealthy socialite Margot, who has been having an affair with American crime-fiction writer Mark Halliday. Unbeknownst to them, Tony knows about the affair and plots Margot\\'s murder to inherit her fortune, fearing a divorce would leave him penniless. \\nTony is also aware that Charles Swann, an old acquaintance from Cambridge University, is a small-time con man with a criminal record. Tony invites Swann to his Maida Vale flat on a pretext, and tells him about Margot\\'s affair. Tony also confides that six months previously, he stole Margot\\'s handbag, which contained a love letter from Mark, and anonymously blackmailed her. After tricking Swann into leaving his fingerprints on the letter, Tony entraps him, threatening to turn him in as Margot\\'s blackmailer unless he kills Margot. With the added inducement of £1,000 in cash, Swann agrees to the murder. Tony then explains that he and Mark will attend a party while Margot stays home alone. At a specific time when Margot is certain to be in bed, Swann will enter the front door, which is always unlocked, and will enter the locked door of the flat with Margot\\'s latchkey, which Tony will hide on the staircase under a carpet. Tony will then telephone the flat from the party and Swann will kill Margot when she answers the call. Swann will whistle over the phone to signal the job is done, then create signs of a burglary gone wrong, and return the key back under the staircase carpet as he is leaving the building.\\nThe following night, Swann enters the flat and Tony calls as planned. When Margot comes to the phone, Swann tries to strangle her with his scarf, but she fatally stabs him with scissors. Upon hearing Margot plead for help instead of Swann\\'s whistle, Tony advises her not to speak to anyone. He returns home, calls the police, sends Margot to bed, and transfers what he thinks is Margot\\'s key from Swann\\'s pocket into her handbag. He also attempts to frame Margot by planting Mark\\'s letter on Swann and destroying Swann\\'s scarf.\\n\\nThe next day Tony persuades Margot to hide the fact that he told her not to call the police. Chief Inspector Hubbard arrives to question the Wendices, though Margot makes several conflicting statements. When Hubbard says the evidence indicates that Swann entered through the front door, Tony claims that Swann must have been responsible for stealing Margot\\'s handbag, and made a copy of her key. As Tony intends, Hubbard does not believe the story and arrests Margot after concluding that she killed Swann for blackmailing her. Margot is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.\\nMonths later, on the day before Margot\\'s scheduled execution, Mark visits Tony, saying he has devised a story for him to tell the police to save Margot. Mark\\'s \"story\" is very close to what actually happened: that Tony paid Swann to kill Margot. If Tony confesses to Mark’s story, Tony would go to jail for a while, but Margot would be saved. Hubbard arrives unexpectedly, and Mark hides in the bedroom. Hubbard asks Tony about large sums of cash he has been spending around town, tricks Tony into revealing that his latchkey is in his raincoat, and inquires about Tony\\'s attaché case. Tony claims to have misplaced the case, but Mark, overhearing the conversation, finds it on the bed, full of banknotes. Deducing that the money was Tony\\'s intended payoff to Swann, Mark confronts Tony and explains his theory to Hubbard. Tony \"confesses\" that the cash was Margot\\'s blackmail payment to Swann, which he had concealed to protect her. Hubbard appears to accept Tony\\'s explanation, and Mark leaves angrily. Hubbard discreetly swaps his own raincoat with Tony\\'s. As soon as Tony leaves, Hubbard uses Tony\\'s key to re-enter the flat, followed by Mark. Hubbard previously discovered that the key in Margot\\'s handbag was Swann\\'s own latchkey and deduced that Swann had put the Wendices\\' key back in its hiding place after unlocking the door. Now, correctly suspecting Tony of having conspired with Swann, Hubbard has developed an elaborate ruse to trap him.\\nPlainclothes police officers bring Margot from prison to the flat. She tries unsuccessfully to unlock the door with the key in her handbag, then enters through the garden, proving to Hubbard that she is unaware of the hidden key and is therefore innocent. Hubbard has Margot\\'s handbag returned to the police station, where Tony retrieves it after discovering that he has no key. The key from Margot\\'s bag does not work, so he uses the hidden key to open the door, demonstrating his guilt and exonerating Margot. With his escape routes blocked by Hubbard and another policeman, Tony calmly makes himself a drink and congratulates Hubbard.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', \"Howl's Moving Castle\": 'Sophie, a young milliner and eldest of three sisters, encounters a wizard named Howl on her way to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning home, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a 90-year-old woman. Seeking to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the countryside. She meets a living scarecrow, whom she calls \"Turnip Head\". He leads her to Howl\\'s moving castle where she enters without invitation. She subsequently meets Howl\\'s young apprentice Markl and a fire demon named Calcifer, the source of the castle\\'s magic and movement. Calcifer makes a deal with Sophie, agreeing to break her curse if she breaks his link with Howl. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that she has \"hired herself\" as a cleaning lady.\\nMeanwhile, Sophie\\'s nation is caught up in a war with a neighboring kingdom, which is searching for its missing prince. The King summons Howl to fight in the war. However, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King, under the pretense of being his mother, to tell him that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives Sophie a charmed ring that leads her to Calcifer and guarantees her safety. Sophie meets Suliman, the king\\'s head sorceress, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power and reverting her to her true age, that of a harmless old woman. Suliman warns Sophie that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight for the king. Howl then arrives to rescue Sophie. Suliman tries to trap him by turning him into a monster, but with Sophie\\'s help he remembers himself and just barely avoids death. The duo escapes along with the former Witch of the Waste and Suliman\\'s dog Heen. In the meantime, soldiers from each kingdom break into the homes of both Jenkins and Pendragon (Howl\\'s aliases in those kingdoms). However, the men only find an empty courtyard and warehouse, as the castle\\'s magic nature allows travel between four separate residences.\\nSophie learns that Howl\\'s life is somehow bound to Calcifer\\'s and that Howl has been transforming into a bird-like creature to interfere with both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Howl then has the castle magically linked to Sophie\\'s home, parking the castle itself on the town\\'s outskirts. A few days later, the town is bombed by enemy aircraft and Suliman\\'s henchmen attack the house and Sophie\\'s hat shop. Howl heads out to protect the group. Sophie then moves everyone out of the house and removes Calcifer from the fireplace, which collapses the castle. The Witch of the Waste realizes that Calcifer has Howl\\'s heart and grabs the fire demon, setting herself on fire. Sophie panics and pours water onto the Witch, which douses Calcifer. The remainder of the castle then splits in two; Sophie falls down a chasm and is separated from the group.\\nFollowing the charmed ring, Sophie wanders into a scene from the past, where she sees a young Howl catch a falling star – Calcifer – and gives him his heart. Sophie calls for them to find her in the future as she is teleported away. She returns to the present, finds Howl, and they reunite with the others. The Witch returns Howl\\'s heart, and Sophie places it back inside Howl, reviving him and freeing Calcifer, though he decides to stay. Sophie\\'s curse is broken, though her hair remains white. After she kisses Turnip Head on the cheek, he returns to human form revealing himself to be Justin, the missing prince from the enemy kingdom. He reveals that only his true love\\'s kiss can break his curse. After seeing Sophie\\'s affection lies with Howl, he promptly heads for home to cease the war, but promises he will see them again. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, also decides to end the war. Sometime later, bombers fly under dark skies over a recovered and green countryside headed to another war, while Sophie, Howl, and the others travel in the opposite direction in a new flying castle.\\n\\n\\n== Voice cast', 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels': 'Long-time friends and small-time London criminals Eddie, Tom, Soap, and Bacon put together £100,000 so that Eddie, a card sharp, can participate in one of \"Hatchet\" Harry Lonsdale\\'s high-stakes three-card brag games.

Riley\\'s experiences become memories that are stored as colored orbs and are sent into long-term memory each night. The aspects of five most-important \"core memories\" within her personality take the form of five floating islands. Joy acts as the leader; she tries to limit Sadness\\'s influence. Joy sees purpose in Fear, Disgust, and Anger but thinks Sadness worsens everything.\\nAt the age of 11, Riley moves from Minnesota to San Francisco for her father\\'s new job. At first, she has poor experiences; the new house is cramped and old, her father hardly has any time for Riley, a local pizza parlor only serves pizza topped with broccoli, which she dislikes, and the moving van with their belongings was misdirected to Texas and will not arrive for weeks. On Riley\\'s first day at her new school, Sadness retroactively saddens joyous memories, causing Riley to cry in front of her class and creates a sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of this memory using a pneumatic tube but accidentally knocks loose the other core memories during a struggle with Sadness, disabling the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters.\\nIn the absence of Joy and Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are forced to take control of Riley; they try to make happy core memories but the results are disastrous, distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies.

The ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and sending Joy and Bing Bong plunging into the Memory Dump. \\nAfter discovering a sad memory that turned happy when Riley\\'s parents and friends comforted her, Joy understands Sadness\\'s purpose in alerting others when Riley is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong\\'s song-fueled wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump. They fail to fully ascend due to their combined weight until Bing Bong jumps out at the last moment and fades away.\\nJoy reunites with Sadness and they return to Headquarters, discovering Anger\\'s idea has disabled the console, putting Riley into depression as she boards a bus to Minnesota.

Dunn admits to killing him after the man confessed to murdering sixteen children for his \"war on God\".\\nThe police captain releases Alex to his aunt, Holly. Convinced of Alex\\'s guilt, Keller Dover, the father of one of the missing girls, assaults him outside the police station, where Alex whispers to him, \"They didn\\'t cry \\'til I left them.\" After Loki finds no proof of this, Keller kidnaps Alex, and begins to torture Alex for information about his daughter, in an empty building Keller owns.\\nAt a vigil for the girls, Loki approaches a suspicious man who flees. Loki releases a sketch of him to the community. The suspect sneaks into the Birch and Dover houses. Grace, Keller\\'s wife, hears him and calls Loki, who learns while responding that Keller spends his nights away from home. He tails Keller to the empty building, where Keller claims he goes to drink, but Loki doesn\\'t find Alex. Loki tracks down the suspect, Bob Taylor, at his house. The walls are covered in maze drawings and Loki opens crates filled with snakes and bloody children\\'s clothes. Loki shows Keller and the Birch parents photos of the bloody clothes, and they identify several as Joy\\'s and Anna\\'s. As Taylor draws detailed mazes, Loki assaults him and demands the location of the girls. Taylor grabs an officer\\'s gun and kills himself.\\nKeller continues torturing Alex for the location of the girls, and Alex cryptically talks about escaping from a maze. Keller visits Holly, learning that Alex\\'s stuttering comes from a childhood accident involving snakes her husband kept. While devoutly religious, Holly and her husband lost their faith after their son died of cancer, and they adopted Alex as a way to cope. Loki matches the maze pattern in Taylor\\'s drawings to a necklace worn by the corpse in Dunn\\'s house. At Taylor\\'s house, Loki is informed that most of the bloody clothes are store-bought and soaked with pig blood. Below a window outside the Dover house, Loki finds Taylor\\'s footprints and a sock matching Anna\\'s, which Keller had earlier identified.\\nThe drugged Anna and Joy attempt to escape, but only Joy gets away and is found and hospitalized. When Keller questions a woozy Joy, she remembers little, but tells him, \"You were there.\" He immediately rushes out. Loki gives chase and arrives at Keller\\'s building expecting to find him, but instead finds Alex. Keller goes to Holly\\'s to find Anna. They talk for a while and then Holly pulls a gun. She explains that before her husband disappeared, they abducted children as part of their war on God to avenge their son\\'s death, and to create demons out of the traumatized parents. Alex was their first abduction, Taylor was their second. Holly imprisons Keller in a hidden pit in her yard, where he finds his daughter\\'s whistle.\\nLoki enters Holly\\'s house to inform her that Alex has been found, but instead finds a photo of her late husband wearing the maze necklace.

Angry over the lack of progress in the investigation, she rents three disused billboards near her home and posts on them: \"Raped While Dying\", \"And Still No Arrests?\", \"How Come, Chief Willoughby?\". They attract attention, so Bill Willoughby, the local chief of police, visits Mildred, but is unable to persuade her to take them down, even by revealing he has terminal pancreatic cancer. He renews his efforts to solve the case, but does not get anywhere.\\nMany townspeople are upset by the billboards, including Jason Dixon, an alcoholic police officer, who unsuccessfully tries to intimidate Red Welby, who rented Mildred the billboards, into taking them down. Mildred\\'s dentist is sympathetic to Willoughby and menaces her during an appointment, so she drills a hole in his thumbnail. Willoughby brings her in for questioning and accidentally coughs up blood into her face. He has her released and is hospitalized, though he soon checks himself out against medical advice.\\nThe billboards have further strained Mildred\\'s relationship with her son, Robbie, and she recalls that her last interaction with Angela was an argument. Her abusive ex-cop ex-husband Charlie confronts her about the billboards and ends up revealing that, shortly before Angela\\'s murder, he had turned down her request to come live with him.\\nAt his mother\\'s suggestion, Dixon arrests Mildred\\'s friend Denise on trivial drug possession charges to put pressure on Mildred. Willoughby spends an idyllic day with his wife, Anne, and their two daughters, and then takes his own life to spare his family from watching him die slowly. Dixon reacts to the news by assaulting Welby and throwing him out a second-story window. This is witnessed by Abercrombie, Willoughby\\'s replacement, who fires Dixon.\\nBefore his death, Willoughby wrote several letters, including one to Mildred. Anne delivers it, interrupting an unknown man who was menacing Mildred at work. In the letter, Willoughby tells Mildred that she was not a factor in his suicide and that he secretly paid to keep the billboards up another month.\\nAfter the billboards are destroyed by arson, Mildred retaliates by tossing Molotov cocktails at the police station, which she believes to be unoccupied for the night. However, Dixon is inside reading Willoughby\\'s letter to him, which advises him to let go of hate and embrace love if he wants to be a detective someday; he manages to escape the blaze with Angela\\'s case file. James, an acquaintance of Mildred, happens by and extinguishes Dixon\\'s burning clothes before providing Mildred with an alibi. Dixon is put in the same hospital room as Welby, to whom he apologizes.\\nJerome, who was part of the team that put up the billboards, brings Mildred a set of copies and helps her restore the signs. Discharged from the hospital, Dixon overhears the man who menaced Mildred bragging in a bar about raping a girl in the same manner as Angela. He notes the number on the man\\'s Idaho license plate and then scratches the man\\'s face to get a DNA sample, passively accepting the resulting beating.\\nMildred is on a date with James to thank him for his help, when Charlie enters with his 19-year-old girlfriend Penelope and apologizes for burning the billboards when he was drunk. Unnerved that she retaliated against the wrong target, Mildred abruptly calls off the date, but James misinterprets her decision as embarrassment to be seen with him and leaves the restaurant in disgust.\\nAbercrombie informs Dixon that the DNA sample is not a match and the man was overseas on military duty at the time of Angela\\'s death. Dixon gives Mildred the disappointing news and, believing the man to be guilty of some other rape, the pair plan a trip to Idaho to kill him. As they set out, Mildred confesses that she set the police station on fire, which Dixon had already assumed. They both express uncertainty about their mission, but Mildred says they can decide what to do along the way.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Bridge on the River Kwai': 'In 1943, a contingent of British prisoners of war, led by Colonel Nicholson, arrive at a Japanese prison camp in Thailand. US Navy Commander Shears tells of the horrific conditions. Nicholson forbids any escape attempts because they were ordered by headquarters to surrender, and escapes could be seen as defiance of orders. Also, the dense surrounding jungle renders escape virtually impossible.\\nColonel Saito, the camp commandant, informs the new prisoners they will all work on the construction of a railway bridge over the River Kwai that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. Nicholson objects, informing Saito the Geneva Convention exempts officers from manual labour. After the enlisted men are marched to the bridge site, Saito threatens to have the officers shot, until Major Clipton, the British medical officer, warns Saito there are too many witnesses for him to get away with murder. Saito leaves the officers standing all day in the intense heat. That evening, the officers are placed in a punishment hut, while Nicholson is beaten and locked in an iron box.\\nShears and two others escape. Only he survives, though he is wounded. He wanders into a Burmese village, is nursed back to health, and eventually reaches the British colony of Ceylon.\\nWork on the bridge proceeds badly, due to both faulty Japanese engineering plans and the prisoners\\' slow pace and sabotage. Saito is expected to commit ritual suicide if he fails to meet the rapidly approaching deadline. Desperate, he uses the anniversary of Japan\\'s 1905 victory in the Russo-Japanese War as an excuse to save face; he announces a general amnesty, releasing Nicholson and his officers and exempting them from manual labour. Nicholson is shocked by the poor job being done by his men and orders the building of a proper bridge, intending it to stand as a tribute to the British Army\\'s ingenuity. Clipton believes this to be collaboration with the enemy. Nicholson\\'s obsession with the bridge drives him to allow his officers to voluntarily engage in manual labor.\\nShears is convalescing in Ceylon, unwittingly within a commando school referred to as \"Force 316\". Major Warden invites Shears to join a commando mission to destroy the bridge before it is completed. Shears tries to get out of the mission by confessing that he impersonated an officer hoping for better treatment from the Japanese. Already aware of that, Warden and the US Navy agreed to transfer Shears to the British with the simulated rank of Major to avoid embarrassment. Realising he has no choice, Shears volunteers.\\nWarden, Shears, and two other commandos - Chapman and Joyce - parachute into Thailand. Chapman dies after falling into a tree, and Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol and must be carried on a litter. He, Shears, and Joyce reach the river with the assistance of Siamese women bearers and their village chief, Khun Yai. Under cover of darkness, Shears and Joyce plant explosives on the bridge towers. A train carrying important dignitaries and soldiers is scheduled to be the first to cross the bridge the following day, and Warden wants to destroy both. By daybreak, however, the river level has dropped, exposing part of the wire connecting the explosives to the detonator. \\nNicholson spots the wire and brings it to Saito\\'s attention. As the train approaches, they hurry down to the riverbank to investigate. Joyce, manning the detonator, breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson yells for help, while attempting to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. Japanese gunfire kills Khun Yai and wounds Joyce. Shears swims across the river, but is himself shot. Recognizing Shears, Nicholson exclaims, \"What have I done?\"\\nWarden fires a mortar, killing Shears and Joyce and fatally wounding Nicholson. Dying, Nicholson stumbles toward the detonator and falls on the plunger, blowing up the bridge. The explosion sends the train hurtling into the river. Warden tells the Siamese women that he had to prevent anyone from falling into enemy hands, and leaves with them. Witnessing the carnage, Clipton shakes his head and exclaims, \"Madness! ... Madness!\"\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Trainspotting': 'In Scotland, Mark Renton, a 26-year-old unemployed heroin addict, lives with his parents in the Edinburgh ward of Leith and regularly takes drugs with his \"friends\": treacherous, womanising James Bond fanatic Simon \"Sick Boy\" Williamson; docile and bumbling Daniel \"Spud\" Murphy; and Swanney—\"Mother Superior\"—their dealer. Renton\\'s other friends, aggressive, alcoholic psychopath Francis \"Franco\" Begbie and honest footballer and recreational speed user Tommy Mackenzie, who both abstain from heroin, warn him about his dangerous drug habit. Growing tired of his reckless lifestyle, Renton attempts to wean himself off heroin with a bare room, foodstuffs, and opium suppositories from ill-reputed dealer Mikey Forrester. He develops diarrhoea and has to relieve himself in the disgusting toilet of a betting shop, then imagines himself swimming in the filthy water as he retrieves the suppositories.\\nRenton attempts to lead a \"useful and fulfilling\" life away from heroin. This consists of him meeting Sick Boy in a park where he shoots a stranger\\'s dog with an air gun, supplying Spud with amphetamine for a job interview that turns disastrous, and stealing a sex tape of Tommy and his girlfriend, Lizzy. At The Volcano nightclub, Renton notices that his cessation of heroin use has increased his libido. He seduces a girl named Diane Coulston, and they return to her apartment to have sex. The following morning, Renton is horrified to learn that she is below the age of consent and lives with her parents, whom Renton initially assumes are her flatmates. Diane threatens to report him to the police if he does not continue the relationship.\\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts to reintegrate into society, Renton, Sick Boy, and Spud relapse into heroin use; Tommy also begins to dabble in drug use after becoming depressed due to being dumped by Lizzy, thanks to the actions of an unknowing Renton. Despite the group’s shock, grief, and horror regarding the negligence-induced death of Dawn, the infant daughter of Sick Boy and his girlfriend Allison, the group still does not recover from their heroin use. Later, Renton, Sick Boy, and Spud are caught shoplifting; Renton and Spud are arrested while Sick Boy narrowly escapes. Spud receives a six-month custodial sentence at HMP Saughton, and Renton narrowly avoids jail by entering a drug rehabilitation programme where he is given methadone to help him. However, Renton quickly relapses and nearly dies of a heroin overdose at Swanney\\'s home. Upon returning home after his revival at the hospital, Renton\\'s parents lock him in his childhood bedroom and force him to go cold turkey. Following a problematic withdrawal punctuated by hallucinations of his friends and visions of Dawn crawling on the ceiling, Renton is released upon the condition of an HIV/AIDS test. Despite years of sharing syringes with other addicts, Renton tests negative.\\nNow clean but bored and devoid of meaning in his life, Renton visits Tommy, who is now severely addicted to heroin and is HIV-positive. On Diane\\'s advice, Renton moves to London and works as a property letting agent. He begins to enjoy his new life of sobriety in London and corresponds with Diane, who updates him on developments back home. To Renton\\'s shock and frustration, Begbie, wanted for a failed armed robbery, tracks him down and takes refuge in his apartment. Sick Boy, now trying to be a pimp and drug dealer, soon joins them. Begbie and Sick Boy later attack two of Renton\\'s clientele (at a supposedly impossible-to-sell property where Renton has sent them to get them off his back), resulting in him losing his job. The trio returns to Edinburgh to avoid police attention and for the funeral of Tommy, who has died of AIDS-related toxoplasmosis.\\nFollowing the funeral, Sick Boy asks Renton, Begbie, and Spud (who has been recently released from prison) for help in buying two kilograms of pure heroin from Mikey Forrester (who got it after a drunken night out with two Russian sailors), for the low price of £4,000, to sell on, with Renton needing to supply the remaining £2,000 asking price. After Begbie threatens him, Renton reluctantly covers the remaining cost, and the group returns to London to sell the heroin to a dealer for £16,000. As they celebrate in a pub, Renton secretly suggests to Spud that they could leave with the money, but Spud, motivated by fear and loyalty, refuses. Sick Boy indicates he would happily do so, and Begbie brutally beats a man after a minor accident. Concluding that Begbie and Sick Boy are unpredictable and dangerous, Renton quietly steals the bag of money and leaves the following morning. Spud witnesses him but does not warn the others. Renton leaves £4,000 in a left-luggage locker for Spud, who \"never hurt anybody\". Begbie, discovering Renton and the money gone, angrily destroys the hotel room where the four stayed, prompting the police to arrive and arrest him as Sick Boy and Spud flee. Spud discreetly claims his share of the money, and Renton walks away to his new life.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Gran Torino': 'Cantankerous, somewhat prejudiced Korean War veteran and retired Ford factory worker Walt Kowalski is widowed after 50 years of marriage.

The trio decide to start their journey to discover and destroy all of Lord Voldemort\\'s Horcruxes, starting from the locket.\\nAttempts to destroy the locket fail. Hermione deduces that Gryffindor\\'s sword can destroy Horcruxes because it is impregnated with basilisk venom. Ron, affected by the dark locket, is frustrated with their slow progress and irrationally jealous of Harry and Hermione. He argues with Harry, then disapparates, leaving Harry and Hermione to continue their journey.

Ron explains that the Deluminator led him to their location.\\nHarry, Ron and Hermione visit Xenophilius Lovegood and learn the symbol represents the Deathly Hallows. Many years before, three brothers each received a prize that evades Death: the Resurrection Stone, the Cloak of Invisibility, and the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand known. Possessing all three makes one the Master of Death. Xenophilius secretly summons the Death Eaters, hoping to exchange Harry for a kidnapped Luna. The three escape, but Snatchers capture them.

Deckard begins to leave, but Bryant ambiguously threatens him and Deckard stays. The two watch a video of a blade runner named Holden administering the Voight-Kampff test, which is designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional responses to questions. The test subject, Leon, shoots Holden on the second question. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and three other Nexus-6 replicants: Roy Batty, Zhora, and Pris.\\nBryant has Deckard meet with the CEO of the company that creates the replicants, Eldon Tyrell, so he can administer the test on a Nexus-6 to see if it works. Tyrell expresses his interest in seeing the test fail first and asks him to administer it on his assistant Rachael. After a much longer than standard test, Deckard concludes privately to Tyrell that Rachael is a replicant who believes she is human. Tyrell explains that she is an experiment who has been given false memories to provide an \"emotional cushion\", and that she has no knowledge of her true nature.\\nIn searching Leon\\'s hotel room, Deckard finds photos and a scale from the skin of an animal, which is later identified as a synthetic snake scale.

Sebastian reveals that because of a genetic premature aging disorder, his life will be cut short, like the replicants that were built with a four-year lifespan. Roy uses Sebastian to gain entrance to Tyrell\\'s penthouse. He demands more life from his maker, which Tyrell says is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done \"questionable things\" but Tyrell dismisses this, praising Roy\\'s advanced design and accomplishments in his short life.

His father, Tom, a PTSD-ridden First World War veteran, is deeply upset by the decision. Desmond and Dorothy get engaged.\\nDoss is placed in basic training under the command of Sergeant Howell. He excels physically but becomes a pariah among his fellow soldiers for refusing to handle a rifle and train on Saturdays. Howell and Captain Glover attempt to discharge Doss for psychiatric reasons under Section 8 but are overruled, as Doss\\'s religious beliefs do not constitute mental illness. They subsequently torment Doss by putting him through grueling labor, intending to drive Doss out. Despite being beaten one night by his fellow soldiers, he refuses to identify his attackers.\\nDoss\\'s unit completes basic training and is released on leave during which Doss intends to marry Dorothy, but his refusal to carry a firearm leads to an arrest for insubordination. Captain Glover and Dorothy visit Doss in jail and try to convince him to plead guilty so that he can be released without charge, but Doss refuses to compromise his beliefs. At his court-martial, Doss pleads not guilty, but before he is sentenced, his father barges into the tribunal with a letter from his former commanding officer (now a brigadier general) stating that his son\\'s pacifism is protected by the US Constitution. The charges against Doss are dropped, and he and Dorothy are married.\\nDoss\\'s unit is assigned to the 77th Infantry Division and deployed to the Pacific Theater. During the Battle of Okinawa, Doss\\'s unit will relieve the 96th Infantry Division, which was tasked with ascending and securing the Maeda Escarpment (\"Hacksaw Ridge\"). During the initial fight, with heavy losses on both sides, Doss saves the life of his squadmate Smitty, earning his respect. As the Americans camp for the night, Doss reveals to Smitty that his aversion to holding a firearm stems from nearly shooting his drunken father, who threatened his mother with a gun. Smitty apologizes for doubting his courage, and both reconcile.\\nThe next morning, the Japanese launch a massive counterattack and drive the Americans off the escarpment. Smitty is killed, and Howell and several of Doss\\'s comrades are left injured on the battlefield. Doss hears the cries of dying soldiers and returns to save them, carrying the wounded, and Smitty\\'s body, to the cliff\\'s edge and belaying them down by rope, each time praying to save one more. The arrival of dozens of wounded who had been presumed dead comes as a shock to the rest of the unit below. When day breaks, Doss rescues Howell, and both escape Hacksaw under enemy fire.\\nCaptain Glover apologizes for dismissing Doss\\'s beliefs as \"cowardice\" and states that they are scheduled to retake the ridge on Saturday but will not launch the next attack without him. Doss agrees, but the operation is delayed until after he concludes his Sabbath prayers. With reinforcements, they turn the tide of battle. In an ambush set by Japanese soldiers who pretend to surrender, Doss manages to save Glover and others by deflecting enemy grenades. Doss is wounded by a grenade blast, but the battle is won. Doss is lowered from the cliff clutching the Bible that Dorothy had given to him.\\nThe film switches to real photos and footage showing that Doss was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman for rescuing 75 soldiers at Hacksaw Ridge, as well as real-life footage of Doss just before his death, recounting his experiences during the war.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'In the Name of the Father': 'In Belfast, Gerry Conlon is mistaken for an IRA sniper by British security forces and pursued until a riot breaks out.

Before specializing, he served as a general practitioner in rural Sweden. He sets out on a long car ride from Stockholm to Lund to be awarded the degree of Doctor Jubilaris 50 years after he received his doctorate from Lund University. He is accompanied by his pregnant daughter-in-law Marianne who does not much like her father-in-law and is planning to separate from her husband, Evald, Isak\\'s only son. Evald does not want her to have the baby, their first.\\nDuring the trip, Isak is forced by nightmares, daydreams, old age, and impending death to reevaluate his life. He meets a series of hitchhikers, each of whom sets off dreams or reveries into Borg\\'s troubled past. The first group consists of two young men and their companion, a woman named Sara who is adored by both men. Sara is a double for the love of Isak\\'s youth. He reminisces about his childhood at the seaside and his sweetheart Sara, with whom he remembered gathering strawberries, but who instead married his brother. The first group remains with him throughout his journey. Next Isak and Marianne pick up an embittered middle-aged couple, the Almans, whose vehicle had nearly collided with theirs. The pair exchanges such terrible vitriol and venom that Marianne stops the car and demands that they leave. The couple reminds Isak of his own unhappy marriage. In a dream sequence, Isak is asked by Sten Alman, now the examiner, to read \"foreign\" letters on the blackboard. He cannot. So, Alman reads it for him: \"A doctor\\'s first duty is to ask forgiveness,\" from which he concludes, \"You are guilty of guilt.\"He is confronted by his loneliness and aloofness, recognizing these traits in both his elderly mother (whom they stop to visit) and in his middle-aged physician son, and he gradually begins to accept himself, his past, his present, and his approaching death.Borg finally arrives at his destination and is promoted to Doctor Jubilaris, but this proves to be an empty ritual.

Local detective Park Doo-man, not having dealt with such a serious case before, is overwhelmed—evidence is improperly collected, the police\\'s investigative methods are suspicious, and their forensic technology is near non-existent. Park claims he has a way of determining suspects by eye contact. He questions a scarred mentally handicapped boy, Baek Kwang-ho, because he used to follow one of the victims around town. Park\\'s partner Cho beats confessions out of Baek.\\nSeo Tae-yoon, a detective from Seoul with more scientific training in crime scene analysis, volunteers to assist them. However his and Park\\'s methods clash. Seo determines Baek is too weak and scared to commit such an elaborate crime and, after closely studying the crime reports, deduces that the killer strikes only on rainy nights and targets women wearing red. Inspector Kwon, the police force\\'s diligent but unrecognized female officer, also has determined that the same obscure song is requested on the local radio station on the night of each crime. Despite a stakeout, the killer eludes them on the next rainy night and kills a woman near a gypsum mine. The next night, Park, Cho and Seo stake out the crime scene and interrupt a man masturbating there. After a chase, they apprehend him, thinking he is the killer. But despite their beating him, his improvised \"confession\" never fits the details of the crime. He does mention a mysterious person who rises out of the outhouses at a local school; this fits with a story that two local schoolgirls told Seo on the night of the most recent murder.\\nSeo uses the story to find the killer\\'s only surviving victim. She tells him details that exclude the man arrested at the crime scene. Park and Seo fight when the man is released, but when the killer strikes again, they agree to work together. Their investigation leads them to Hyeon-gyu, a clerk at the gypsum factory. Seo notes that Hyeon-gyu\\'s hands are soft like the survivor had described, but they have no other evidence to go on. Listening to Baek\\'s \"confession\" again, they realize that he had seen one of the murders as it occurred. They go to the restaurant run by Baek\\'s father, where they encounter a drunken Cho, who has been suspended from the police force for beating Hyeon-gyu. When other patrons mock the police for not solving the crime, Cho instigates a brawl. Baek stabs him in the leg with a rusty nail then runs off. Park and Seo chase him, but before they can learn what he knows, the frightened Baek stumbles in front of a passing train and is killed. \\nPark feels guilty when Cho\\'s leg develops tetanus and will have to be amputated. The coroner discovers semen in the latest victim, and Seo arranges for the sample to be sent to the U.S. for DNA testing that will confirm if Hyeon-gyu is the killer. On the next rainy night, Seo loses track of Hyeon-gyu while observing him and one of the schoolgirls Seo had befriended is the next victim. Enraged, Seo attacks Hyeon-gyu the next day. Park interrupts him with the results of the DNA test. They are inconclusive--Hyeong-gyu is neither confirmed nor excluded as a suspect. Seo tries to shoot Hyeon-gyu anyway but Park stops him and Hyeon-gyu is allowed to leave. \\nIn 2003, the crimes remained unsolved and Park is now a father and businessman. He passes by the first crime scene and stops to view the spot where the victim was found. A young girl tells him about a man she had seen there before who said he was reminiscing about something he had done there a long time ago. Park asks the girl what the man looks like, and she tells him that he looks very ordinary. Shaken, Park stares into the camera.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Third Man': 'Holly Martins, an American author of western fiction, arrives in post–World War II Vienna seeking his childhood friend, Harry Lime, who has offered him a job.

At Lime\\'s funeral, Martins meets two British Royal Military Police: Sergeant Paine, a fan of Martins\\'s books, and Major Calloway. Afterward, Martins is asked by Mr. Crabbin to lecture at a book club a few days later. He then meets a friend of Lime\\'s, \"Baron\" Kurtz, who tells Martins that he and another friend, a Romanian called Popescu, carried Lime to the side of the street after the accident. Before he died, Lime asked them to take care of Martins as well as Lime\\'s girlfriend, actress Anna Schmidt.\\nAs Martins and Anna query Lime\\'s death, they realise that accounts differ as to whether Lime was able to speak before his death, and whether two or three men carried away the body. The porter at Lime\\'s apartment tells them that he saw a third man help carry away the body. Later, the porter offers to give Martins more information, but he is murdered before Martins can talk to him. Martins confronts Major Calloway and demands that Lime\\'s death be investigated.

Martins again agrees to help the police .\\nLime arrives at a small café to meet Martins, but Anna is able to warn Lime that the police are closing in. He tries again to escape using the sewer tunnels, but the police are prepared and pursue him below ground. Lime shoots and kills Sgt. Paine, but Calloway shoots and badly wounds Lime. Injured, Lime drags himself up a cast-iron stairway to a street grating; however, he cannot lift it. Martins finds Lime at the grating and they exchange a look. They hear Calloway shouting that Martins must take no chances and that if he finds Lime he must shoot him on sight. Trapped, and still looking at his old friend, Harry nods his head slightly and Martins shoots and kills him, using Paine\\'s pistol.\\nMartins attends Lime\\'s second funeral, at the risk of missing his flight out of Vienna. He waits on the cemetery path to speak with Anna, but she totally ignores him and walks right past without even glancing in his direction.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'The Wages of Fear': 'Frenchmen Mario and Jo, Dutchman Bimba and Italian Luigi are stuck in the isolated town of Las Piedras. Surrounded by desert, the town is linked to the outside world only by an airstrip, but the airfare is beyond the means of the men. There is little opportunity for employment aside from the American corporation that dominates the town, Southern Oil Company (SOC), which operates the nearby oil fields and owns a walled compound within the town. SOC exploits local workers and takes the law into its own hands, but the townspeople depend on it and suffer in silence.\\nMario is a sarcastic Corsican playboy who treats his devoted lover, Linda, with disdain. Jo is an aging ex-gangster who recently found himself stranded in the town. Bimba is an intense, quiet man whose father was murdered by the Nazis and who himself worked for three years in a salt mine. Luigi, Mario\\'s roommate, is a jovial, hardworking man, who has just learned that he is dying from cement dust in his lungs. Mario befriends Jo due to their common background, having lived in Paris, but a rift develops between Jo and the other cantina regulars due to his combative, arrogant personality.\\nA massive fire erupts at one of the SOC oil fields. The only way to extinguish the flames and cap the well is an explosion produced by nitroglycerine. With short notice and lack of proper equipment, it must be transported within jerrycans placed in two large trucks from the SOC headquarters, 500 km (300 miles) away. Due to the poor condition of the roads and the highly volatile nature of nitroglycerine, the job is considered too dangerous for the unionized SOC employees.\\nThe company foreman, Bill O\\'Brien, recruits truck drivers from the local community. Despite the dangers, many of the locals volunteer, lured by the high pay: US$2,000 per driver. This is a fortune to them, perhaps the only way out of their dead-end lives. The pool of applicants is narrowed down to four drivers: Mario, Bimba and Luigi are chosen, along with a German named Smerloff. Smerloff fails to appear on the appointed day, so Jo, who knows O\\' Brien from his bootlegging days, takes his place. The other drivers suspect that Jo intimidated Smerloff in some way to facilitate his own hiring.\\nJo and Mario transport the nitroglycerin in one vehicle; Luigi and Bimba are in the other, with thirty minutes separating them in order to limit potential casualties. The drivers are forced to deal with a series of physical and mental obstacles, including a stretch of extremely rough road called \"the washboard\", a construction barricade that forces them to teeter around a rotten platform above a precipice, and a boulder blocking the road. Jo finds that his nerves are not what they used to be, and the others confront Jo about his increasing cowardice. Finally, Luigi and Bimba\\'s truck explodes without warning, killing them both.\\nMario and Jo arrive at the scene of the explosion only to find a large crater rapidly filling with oil from a pipeline ruptured in the blast. Jo exits the vehicle to help Mario navigate through the oil-filled crater. The truck, however, is in danger of becoming bogged down and, during their frantic attempts to prevent it from getting stuck, Mario runs over Jo. Although the vehicle is ultimately freed from the muck, Jo is mortally injured. On their arrival at the oil field, Mario and Jo are hailed as heroes, but Jo is dead and Mario collapses from exhaustion. Upon his recovery, he heads home in the same truck. He collects double the wages following his friends\\' deaths and refuses the chauffeur offered by SOC. Mario jubilantly drives down a mountain road as a party is being held at the cantina back in town, where Mario\\'s friends eagerly await his arrival. He swerves recklessly and intentionally, having cheated death so many times on the same road. Linda, dancing in the cantina, faints.

He later gives her a ring.\\nThe sheik comes into the house and steals the woman\\'s father\\'s pocket watch and pawns it for $4. With the money, he buys a $3 box of chocolates for the woman. When the father notices that his watch is missing, the sheik slips the pawn ticket into the projectionist\\'s pocket unnoticed. The projectionist, studying to be a detective, offers to solve the crime, but when the pawn ticket is found in his pocket, he is banished from the house. However, when the sheik leaves, he walks closely behind him and shadows every movement. The sheik loses him by shutting him in a train car. Later, the woman takes the pawn ticket to the pawnbroker and asks him to describe who pawned it. He points to the sheik outside.\\nWhile showing a film (advertised in the lobby as \"Hearts and Pearls\") about the theft of a pearl necklace, the projectionist falls asleep and dreams that he enters the movie as a detective, Sherlock Jr. The other actors are replaced by the projectionist\\'s \"real\" acquaintances. The dream begins with the theft being committed by the villain with the aid of the butler. The woman\\'s father calls for the world\\'s greatest detective and Sherlock Jr. arrives.\\nFearing that they will be caught, the villain and the butler attempt to kill Sherlock through several traps, poison, and an elaborate pool game with an exploding 13 ball. When these fail, the villain and butler try to escape. Sherlock Jr. tracks them down to a warehouse but is outnumbered by the gang to which the villain was selling the necklace. During the confrontation, Sherlock discovers that they have kidnapped the woman. With the help of his assistant, Gillette, Sherlock Jr. manages to save the woman, and after a car chase, manages to defeat the gang.\\nWhen he awakens, the woman shows up to tell him that she and her father learned the identity of the real thief after she went to the pawn shop to see who actually pawned the pocket watch. As a reconciliation scene happens to be playing on the screen, the projectionist mimics the actor\\'s romantic behavior.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Mad Max: Fury Road': 'Max Rockatansky, a survivor haunted by memories of all the people he failed to protect, is captured and taken to warlord Immortan Joe\\'s Citadel. There, Max is imprisoned and used as a \"blood bag\" for Nux, a sick War Boy. Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa, one of Joe\\'s lieutenants, is sent in the armoured \"War Rig\" to trade produce for petrol and ammunition with two of Joe\\'s allies, the Bullet Farmer and the People Eater. When Joe realises his five wives are fleeing in the Rig, he leads his army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of Gas Town and the Bullet Farm. \\nNux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car, and a chasing battle ensues. Furiosa drives into a sand storm and loses all of her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to blow up the Rig. Max frees himself and restrains Nux, and Furiosa destroys their car.\\nAfter the sandstorm, Max finds Furiosa repairing the Rig, accompanied by Joe\\'s wives: Toast, Capable, the Dag, Cheedo, and Angharad, the last of whom is heavily pregnant with Joe\\'s child. Max tries to steal the Rig, but he does not know the code to bypass the kill switches, so he begrudgingly joins up with Furiosa and the wives. Nux boards the Rig as it leaves and attempts to kill Furiosa. He is overpowered and thrown out, and Joe\\'s army picks him up when they pass by. \\nFuriosa drives through a canyon controlled by a biker gang, having arranged to trade fuel for her safe passage, but the gang turns on her when they spot an army approaching, forcing her to flee. The bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe and then pursue the Rig, as Max and Furiosa fend them off. Joe drives over the blockade in a monster truck and catches up with the Rig, allowing Nux to board and attack Furiosa again, but he trips before reaching the cab. While helping Max, Angharad falls off the Rig and is fatally run over by Joe, who temporarily halts his pursuit.\\nCapable finds Nux hiding in the Rig and consoles him as he laments his failure. After dark, Furiosa and Max slow Joe\\'s forces with mines set in swampland, but Joe\\'s ally, the Bullet Farmer, continues to pursue. The Rig gets stuck in the mud, and Nux emerges from hiding to help free it, joining the crew. Furiosa blinds the approaching Bullet Farmer, and Max confronts him and returns with guns and ammunition. \\nIn the morning, Furiosa explains to Max that the \"Green Place\" to which they are escaping is an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood. She recognises a familiar landmark and shouts out her history and clan affiliation to a woman on top. The woman summons her all-female clan, the Vuvalini, who recognise Furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped as a child. Furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland from the previous night was the Green Place, which is now uninhabitable, and there are only seven Vuvalini left. The group begins to ride across an immense salt flat, hoping to find a new home, but Max leaves.\\nAfter seeing a vision of a child he failed to save, Max catches up and convinces the others to return the way they came, since there is nothing in the salt flat, suggesting instead that they return and take the undefended Citadel, which has ample water and crops. They meet Joe\\'s forces and engage in battle. Five Vuvalini are killed, and Toast is captured. As they approach the canyon, Joe gets in front of the Rig to slow it. While Max fights Joe\\'s large adult son, Rictus Erectus, Furiosa, though seriously wounded, goes to save Toast and kills Joe. The surviving brides and Vuvalini cross over to Joe\\'s vehicle, and Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig to block the canyon, killing Rictus. Max transfuses his blood to Furiosa, saving her life. Back at the Citadel, the people rejoice upon learning of Joe\\'s death and tear his corpse to pieces. As Max\\'s companions are lifted in triumph to Joe\\'s cliffside fortress, Max exchanges a glance with Furiosa and disappears into the crowd.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington': 'In the late 1930s, the governor of an unnamed western state, Hubert \"Happy\" Hopper, appoints Jefferson Smith to replace deceased U.S. Senator Sam Foley. Smith is head of the Boy Rangers, and his appointment is supported by the governor’s children. Corrupt political boss, Jim Taylor, sought the appointment of his handpicked stooge, while popular committees wanted another candidate. Smith, however, was chosen because his naivety about politics would make him easy to manipulate.\\nSmith is taken under the wing of the publicly esteemed, but secretly crooked, Senator Joseph Paine, who was Smith\\'s late father\\'s friend. Smith develops an immediate attraction to the senator\\'s daughter, Susan. At Senator Paine\\'s home, Smith has a conversation with Susan, fidgeting and bumbling, entranced by the young socialite. Smith\\'s naïve and honest nature allows the unforgiving Washington press to take advantage of him, quickly tarnishing Smith\\'s reputation with ridiculous front-page pictures and headlines branding him a bumpkin.\\nTo keep Smith busy, Paine suggests he propose a bill. With the help of his secretary, Clarissa Saunders, who was the aide to Smith\\'s predecessor and had been around Washington and politics for years, Smith comes up with a bill to authorize a federal government loan to buy some land in his home state for a national boys\\' camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America. Donations pour in immediately. However, the proposed campsite is already part of a dam-building graft scheme included in an appropriations bill framed by the Taylor political machine and supported by Senator Paine.\\nUnwilling to crucify the worshipful Smith so that their graft plan will go through, Paine tells Taylor he wants out, but Taylor reminds him that Paine is in power primarily through Taylor\\'s influence. Paine then advises Smith to keep silent about the matter. The following day, when Smith speaks out about the bill at Senate, the machine in his state—through Paine—accuses Smith of trying to profit from his bill by producing fraudulent evidence that Smith already owns the land in question. Smith is too shocked and angry by Paine\\'s betrayal to defend himself and runs away.\\nSaunders, who looked down on Smith at first, but has come to believe in him, talks him into launching a filibuster to postpone the appropriations bill and prove his innocence on the Senate floor just before the vote to expel him. In his last chance to prove his innocence, he talks non-stop for about 25 hours, reaffirming the American ideals of freedom and disclosing the dam scheme\\'s true motives. Yet none of the senators are convinced.\\nThe constituents try to rally around him, but the entrenched opposition is too powerful, and all attempts are crushed. Owing to the influence of Taylor\\'s machine, newspapers and radio stations in Smith\\'s home state, on Taylor\\'s orders, refuse to report what Smith has to say and even distort the facts against the senator. The Boy Rangers\\' effort to spread the news in support of Smith results in vicious attacks on the children by Taylor\\'s minions.\\nAlthough all hope seems lost, the senators begin to pay attention as Smith approaches utter exhaustion. Paine has one last card up his sleeve: he brings in bins of letters and telegrams from Smith\\'s home state, purportedly from average people demanding his expulsion. Nearly broken by the news, Smith finds a small ray of hope in a friendly smile from the President of the Senate. Smith vows to press on until people believe him but immediately collapses in a faint. Overcome with the pangs of remorse, Paine leaves the Senate chamber and attempts to commit suicide by gunshot but is stopped by onlooking senators. He then bursts back into the Senate chamber, shouting a confession to the whole scheme; the reformed Paine further insists that he must be expelled from the Senate and affirms Smith\\'s innocence to Clarissa\\'s delight. The President of the Senate observes the ensuing chaos with amusement.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Dead Poets Society': 'In 1959, Todd Anderson begins his junior year of high school at Welton Academy, an all-male preparatory boarding school in Vermont. Assigned one of Welton\\'s most promising students, senior Neil Perry, as his roommate, he meets Neil\\'s friends: Knox Overstreet, Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, and Charlie Dalton.\\nOn the first day of classes, the boys are surprised by the unorthodox teaching methods of new English teacher, John Keating. A Welton alumnus himself, Keating encourages his students to \"make your lives extraordinary\", a sentiment he summarizes with the Latin expression carpe diem (\"seize the day\").\\nSubsequent lessons include Keating having the students take turns standing on his desk to demonstrate ways to look at life differently, telling them to rip out the introduction of their poetry books which explains a mathematical formula used for rating poetry, and inviting them to make up their own style of walking in a courtyard to encourage their individualism. Keating\\'s methods attract the attention of strict headmaster, Gale Nolan.\\nUpon learning that Keating was a member of the unsanctioned Dead Poets Society while at Welton, Neil restarts the club and he and his friends sneak off campus to a cave where they read poetry. As the school year progresses, Keating\\'s lessons and their involvement with the club encourage them to live their lives on their own terms. Knox pursues Chris Noel, an attractive cheerleader who is dating Chet Danburry, a football player from a local public school whose family is friends with his.\\nNeil discovers his love of acting and gets the role as Puck in a local production of A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream, despite the fact that his domineering father wants him to attend Harvard to study medicine. Meanwhile, Keating helps Todd come out of his shell and realize his potential when he takes him through an exercise in self-expression, resulting in his composing a poem spontaneously in front of the class, making everyone applaud for Todd.\\nCharlie publishes an article in the school newspaper in the club\\'s name suggesting that girls be admitted to Welton. Nolan paddles Charlie to coerce him into revealing who else is in the Dead Poets Society, but he resists. Nolan also speaks with Keating, warning him that he should discourage his students from questioning authority. Keating admonishes the boys in his manner, warning that one must assess all consequences.\\nNeil becomes devastated after his father discovers his involvement in the play and demands he quit on the eve of the opening performance. He goes to Keating, who advises him to stand his ground and prove to his father that his love of acting is something he takes seriously. Neil\\'s father unexpectedly shows up at the performance. He angrily takes Neil home and has him withdrawn from Welton and enrolled in a military academy. Lacking any support from his concerned mother, and unable to explain how he feels to his father, a distraught Neil commits suicide.\\nNolan investigates Neil\\'s death at the request of Neil\\'s parents. Cameron blames Neil\\'s death on Keating to escape punishment for his own participation in the Dead Poets Society, and names the other members. Confronted by Charlie, Cameron urges the rest of them to let Keating take the fall. Charlie punches Cameron and is expelled. Each of the boys is called to Nolan\\'s office to sign a letter attesting to the truth of Cameron\\'s allegations, even knowing they are false. When Todd\\'s turn comes, he is reluctant to sign, but does so after seeing that the others have complied and succumbs to his parents\\' pressure.\\nKeating is fired and Nolan, who taught English at Welton prior to becoming headmaster, takes over teaching the class, with the intent of adhering to traditional Welton rules. Keating interrupts the class to gather his belongings. As he leaves, Todd reveals to Keating that the boys were intimidated into signing the letter that sealed his fate, and he assures Todd that he believes him. Nolan threatens to expel Todd and anyone else who speaks out of line. Despite this, Todd stands up on his desk and states the words \"O Captain! My Captain!\" The other members of the Dead Poets Society (except for Cameron), as well as several other students in the class, do the same, to Nolan\\'s fury and Keating\\'s pleased surprise. Touched by their support, Keating proudly thanks the boys and departs as Todd looks on.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Monsters, Inc.': 'In a world inhabited by monsters, the city of Monstropolis harnesses the screams of human children for energy. At the Monsters, Incorporated factory, skilled monsters employed as \"scarers\" venture into the human world to scare children and harvest their screams through doors that activate portals to children\\'s bedroom closets. The work is considered dangerous, as human children are perceived as toxic and capable of killing a monster through physical contact. Energy production is declining because children are becoming less afraid, and the company\\'s CEO, Henry J. Waternoose III, is determined to prevent the company\\'s collapse.\\nOne evening after work, James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan, a top-ranking scarer, discovers that an active door has been left in the station of Randall Boggs, his rival. He inspects the door and accidentally lets a young human girl into the factory. Frightened, Sulley unsuccessfully attempts to return the girl, who escapes into Monstropolis, interrupting Mike Wazowski, Sulley\\'s best friend and assistant, on a date with Celia, his girlfriend and the receptionist of Monsters Inc., at a sushi restaurant. Chaos erupts when other monsters see the girl, but Sulley and Mike escape with her before the Child Detection Agency (CDA) arrives and quarantines the restaurant. Forced to keep the girl hidden in their apartment for the night, Sulley soon realizes she is not toxic, and her laughter is very powerful.\\nThe next day, Sulley and Mike take the girl to the factory disguised as a monster. While Mike seeks out her door, Sulley grows attached to her and nicknames her \"Boo.\" Randall, waiting in ambush for the girl, accidentally captures Mike and reveals his plan to kidnap children and harvest their screams using his new invention, the scream extractor. Sulley rescues Mike, and they head to the training room to report Randall to Mr. Waternoose. There, he forces Sulley to give a scare demonstration, which frightens Boo and makes Sulley realize how wrong scaring children is. Boo reveals herself, and Mike tells Waternoose about Randall\\'s plan. However, he reveals he is on Randall\\'s side, kidnaps Boo, and uses a door to exile Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas. Sulley heads to a nearby village to return to the factory, but Mike initially refuses to go with him.\\nSulley saves Boo from the scream extractor, and Randall attacks him. Mike returns to reconcile with Sulley and exposes Randall, who pursues them and Boo into the enormous door storage vault; Randall manages to catch up but is defeated by Boo. The trio then hurl Randall through a door to the Everglades, which they then destroy, leaving Randall permanently trapped in the human world. When Mike and Sulley locate Boo\\'s door, Waternoose, accompanied by the CDA, brings it down to the scare floor to arrest Mike and Sulley. Mike distracts the CDA while Sulley and Boo escape, leading Waternoose into the training room, where he reveals his conspiracy to kidnap as many children as necessary to keep the company afloat. Mike records the conversation and reveals it to the CDA, and Waternoose is arrested. Roz, a scare floor administrator, who reveals herself as the CDA\\'s undercover director, orders Sulley to send Boo home, and after Sulley sadly says goodbye to Boo, the door is shredded.\\nAfterward, Sulley retools the company\\'s power generation method to harvest children\\'s laughter instead of screams, as laughter is ten times more powerful. With the energy crisis solved, the factory is now focused on making children laugh to collect energy; Mike becomes the company\\'s top comedian, and Sulley is named the new CEO. Mike surprises Sulley by revealing he rebuilt Boo\\'s shredded door. Sulley enters the door and reunites with Boo.\\n\\n\\n== Voice cast', 'How to Train Your Dragon': \"The Viking village of Berk is frequently attacked by dragons, which steal livestock and endanger the villagers. Hiccup, the son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, is deemed too weak to fight the dragons.

Hiccup uses a bolas launcher to shoot down a Night Fury, a rare and dangerous dragon, but cannot bring himself to kill the creature and sets him free.\\nBefore leaving with his fleet to find and destroy the dragons' nest, Stoick enters Hiccup in a dragon-fighting class taught by Gobber with fellow teenagers Fishlegs, Snotlout, twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut, and Astrid, on whom Hiccup has a crush. Failing in training, Hiccup returns to the forest and finds the Night Fury trapped in a cove, unable to fly because Hiccup's bolas tore off half his tail fin.

She takes time from her busy office job to take Shūkichi and Tomi on a sightseeing tour of metropolitan Tokyo.\\nFeeling conflicted that they do not have time to entertain them, Kōichi and Shige pay for their parents to stay at a hot spring spa at Atami, but they return early because the nightlife disturbs their sleep. Tomi also has an unexplained dizzy spell. Upon returning, a frustrated Shige explains she sent them to Atami because she wanted to use their bedroom for a meeting; the elderly couple has to leave for the evening. Tomi goes to stay with Noriko, with whom she deepens their emotional bond, and advises her to remarry. Shūkichi, meanwhile, gets drunk with some old friends from Onomichi. The three men drunkenly ramble about their children and lives. A policeman brings Shūkichi and one of his friends to Shige's salon. Shige is outraged her father is lapsing into the alcoholic ways that overshadowed her childhood.\\nThe couple remarks on how their children have changed, returning home earlier than planned, intending to see their younger son Keizō when the train stops in Osaka. However, Tomi suddenly becomes ill during the journey and they decide to disembark the train, staying till she feels better the next day. They return to Onomichi, and Tomi falls critically ill. Kōichi, Shige, and Noriko rush to Onomichi to see Tomi, who dies shortly afterwards. Keizō arrives too late, as he has been away on business.\\nAfter the funeral, Kōichi, Shige, and Keizō leave immediately; only Noriko remains. After they leave, Kyōko criticises her siblings over their selfishness toward their parents. She believes that Kōichi, Shige, and Keizō do not care how hard it will be for their father now that he has lost their mother. She is also upset at Shige for asking so quickly for Tomi's clothes as keepsakes. Noriko responds that while she understands Kyōko's disappointment, everyone has their own life and the growing chasm between parents and children is inevitable. She convinces Kyōko not to be too hard on her siblings because one day she will understand how hard it is to take time away from one's own life.\\nAfter Kyōko leaves for school, Noriko informs her father-in-law that she must return to Tokyo that afternoon. Shūkichi tells her that she has treated them better than their own children despite not being a blood relation. Noriko protests that she is selfish and has not always thought about her missing husband, and Shūkichi credits her self-assessment to humility. He gives her a watch from the late Tomi as a memento. Noriko cries and confesses her loneliness; Shūkichi encourages her to remarry as soon as possible, wanting her to be happy. Noriko travels from Onomichi back to Tokyo, contemplating the watch, while Shūkichi remains behind, resigned to the solitude he must endure.\\n\\n\\n=== Hirayama family tree ===\\n\\n\\n== Cast\", 'Ford v Ferrari': 'In 1963, Ford Motor Company Vice President Lee Iacocca proposes to Henry Ford II to boost their car sales by purchasing Italian car manufacturer Ferrari, dominant in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Owner Enzo Ferrari uses Ford\\'s offer to secure a deal with Fiat that allows him to retain ownership of the firm\\'s racing team, Scuderia Ferrari. He insults Ford II and the whole Ford Motor Company. Ford orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. Iacocca hires Shelby American owner Carroll Shelby, a retired driver who won Le Mans in 1959. Shelby enlists his friend Ken Miles, a hot-tempered British racer and mechanical engineer.\\nShelby and Miles develop the UK-built Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles International Airport. At the launch of the new Ford Mustang, Miles gives a witheringly rude appraisal of it to Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe. Beebe campaigns against sending Miles to the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans as a public relations liability. Shelby reluctantly excludes Miles and sends Phil Hill and Bruce McLaren to Le Mans. None of the Fords finish.\\nWhen Ford demands why he should not sack Shelby, Shelby explains that despite the GT40\\'s reliability problems, it instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari by reaching 218 mph (350.8 km/h), on the Mulsanne Straight before breaking down. He says a racing car cannot be designed by committee. Ford tells him to continue the project and report directly to him. During testing of the GT40 Mk II, the recurrent problem of brake fade causes a crash and fire, which Miles survives. The team realizes the rules permit replacing the whole brake assembly during the race.\\nIn 1966, Beebe takes over the racing division. When he and Ford arrive to inspect the program, Shelby locks Beebe in his office and gives Ford a ride in the GT40. Shelby makes a deal with Ford: if Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona then he will race at Le Mans. If not, Ford will take full ownership of Shelby American. At Daytona, Beebe enters a second GT40 supported by a NASCAR team with quicker pit stops. Shelby clears Miles to push his car beyond the 7,000 RPM redline, and he wins.\\nAt the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap. The pit crew fixes it and Miles sets lap records catching the Ferraris.  The GT40 suffers brake fade while dicing with the prototype 330 P3 Ferrari of Lorenzo Bandini, so Miles limps into the pits for replacement of the entire braking system. Ferrari protests but Shelby assures race officials it is legal.\\nMiles and Bandini duel on the Mulsanne Straight until the Ferrari engine blows. With Fords in the top three positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other Fords to catch him and give the press a three-car photo finish. Shelby tells Miles what Beebe wants but says it is Miles\\'s call. Miles initially continues to set new lap records, but decides to comply on the final lap.\\nMcLaren is declared the winner as, having started behind Miles, his car traveled further overall. Miles is placed second. Shelby accuses Beebe of deliberately costing Miles the win, but an unusually sanguine Miles lets it pass, saying to Shelby, \"You promised me the drive, not the win.\" From his vantage point, Enzo Ferrari tips his hat to Miles on the track. As they walk off together, Shelby tells Miles they will win Le Mans next time.\\nTwo months later, during testing at Riverside International Raceway, a mechanical failure in the J-car kills Miles in a crash. Six months later, Shelby parks outside Miles\\'s widow Mollie\\'s house and hesitates. Miles\\'s son Peter arrives and the two talk about Miles. Shelby gives Peter a wrench that Miles once threw at him in anger.\\nEpilogue text says Ford continued its Le Mans winning streak in 1967, 1968, and 1969, and Miles was posthumously inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2001.\\n\\n\\n== Cast', 'Ratatouille': 'Remy, a young rat with heightened senses of taste and smell, dreams of becoming a chef like his human idol, the late Auguste Gusteau, but the rest of his colony, including his older brother Émile and his father, the clan leader Django, only eat for sustenance and are wary of humans. The rats live in an elderly woman\\'s attic outside Paris, but when the woman discovers them, they are forced to evacuate, and Remy is separated from the others. Encouraged by an imaginary Gusteau, he explores until he finds himself on the roof of Gusteau\\'s restaurant.\\nRemy notices the restaurant\\'s new garbage boy, Alfredo Linguini, attempting to fix a soup he ruined, and jumps in to fix Linguini\\'s mistakes. Linguini catches Remy in the act, but does not reveal him to Skinner, Gusteau\\'s former sous-chef and the new owner of the restaurant. Skinner confronts Linguini for tampering with the soup, but when the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success, Colette Tatou, the restaurant\\'s only female chef, convinces Skinner to retain Linguini and uphold Gusteau\\'s motto, \"Anyone can cook\". After demanding that Linguini replicate the soup, Skinner spots Remy and orders Linguini to take him outside and kill him. Once they are alone, Linguini discovers that Remy can understand him, and he convinces Remy to help him cook.\\nRemy controls Linguini\\'s movements like a marionette by pulling on his hair while hiding under his toque. They recreate the soup, and continue cooking at the restaurant. Colette begrudgingly trains Linguini, but steadily comes to appreciate someone heeding her advice. Later, Remy finds Émile and reunites with the clan. After Remy tells Django that he intends to stay at the restaurant, Django shows him a group of exterminated rats in an attempt to convince him that humans are dangerous, but Remy ignores his warnings and leaves.\\nMeanwhile, Skinner discovers through a letter from Linguini\\'s late mother that Linguini is Gusteau\\'s illegitimate son, and the rightful owner of the restaurant. Skinner is shocked and enraged about this revelation, as Gusteau\\'s will stated that he would inherit ownership of the restaurant, only if no biological heir appeared two years prior to the latter\\'s death. After his lawyer verifies that Linguini is Gusteau\\'s heir, Skinner hides the evidence in an envelope, but Remy finds it and runs away, showing the documents to Linguini, who then forces Skinner out. The restaurant thrives as Remy\\'s recipes become popular, and Linguini\\'s life improves as he develops a romantic relationship with Colette. Food critic Anton Ego, whose previous negative review of the restaurant indirectly led to Gusteau\\'s death, announces to Linguini that he will dine at the restaurant. After Linguini takes credit for Remy\\'s cooking at a press conference, he and Remy have a falling out. As revenge, Remy leads his clan to raid the restaurant\\'s pantries for food. Linguini arrives to apologize, but upon discovering the raid, he furiously kicks Remy and the other rats out.\\nThe next day, Remy is captured by Skinner but promptly freed by Django and Émile. After returning to the restaurant, he and Linguini reconcile, and Linguini reveals the truth to his staff, who all immediately quit. Reminded of Gusteau\\'s motto, Colette returns to help Django and the clan cook to Remy\\'s directions, while Linguini waits tables. Skinner and a health inspector attempt to interfere, but are locked in the pantry by the rats. Remy creates a variation of ratatouille which reminds Ego of his mother\\'s cooking. Ego asks to meet the chef, and is stunned upon being introduced to Remy after the restaurant closes for the evening. The next day, he writes a review titled \"France\\'s Finest\", stating that he has come to understand Gusteau\\'s motto, and describes Remy - without revealing that he is a rat - as \"nothing less than the finest chef in France\".\\nAfter Skinner and the health inspector are released, they inform the authorities and the restaurant is shut down, stripping Ego of his job and credibility. Remy, Linguini and Colette open a bistro, called La Ratatouille, which a now-happier Ego invests in and frequently visits; the rat colony settles into the bistro\\'s attic as their new home.\\n\\n\\n== Voice cast', 'Hotel Rwanda': 'In April 1994, tensions between the Hutu-controlled government and Tutsi rebels led to genocide in Rwanda, where corruption and bribes between politicians were routine. Paul Rusesabagina, manager of the Belgian-owned Hôtel des Mille Collines, is Hutu, but his wife Tatiana is Tutsi. Their marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, including Georges Rutaganda, a goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal Hutu militia.\\nPaul curries favor with Rwandan Army  general Augustin Bizimungu, who favors the Hutu. Following the assassination of the president, a Hutu, Paul and his family observe neighbors being killed, initiating the early stages of the genocide. When civil war erupts and a Rwandan Army Captain threatens Paul and his neighbors, Paul barely negotiates their safety and brings them to the hotel. Upon returning with them, he finds his insolent receptionist Gregoire occupying the presidential suite and threatening to expose the Tutsi refugees, including Paul\\'s wife, if he is made to work.\\nThe UN peacekeeping forces, led by Canadian Colonel Oliver, are forbidden to intervene in the conflict and prevent the genocide. The foreign nationals are evacuated, but the Rwandans are left behind.\\nMore evacuees arrive at the hotel from the overburdened United Nations refugee camp, the Red Cross, and various orphanages, totaling 800, both Tutsi and Hutu. Tatiana desperately searches for her brother, sister-in-law, and two nieces. As the situation becomes more violent, Paul must divert the Hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, protect his family, and maintain the appearance of a functioning 4-star hotel. Paul forces Gregoire to work with the help of General Bizimungu.\\nLow on supplies, Paul and Gregoire drive to collect hotel supplies from Georges Rutaganda and witness the Interahamwe militia raping Tutsi hostages. Georges explains to Paul that the \"rich cockroaches\\'\" money will become worthless since all of the Tutsis will be killed. Paul expresses disbelief that the Hutu extremists will wipe out all of the Tutsis, but Georges replies: \"Why not? We are halfway there already.\" They return to the hotel through the dark, thick fog, on the riverside road recommended by Georges, only to find it is carpeted with dead bodies.\\nWhen the UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Paul\\'s family, Gregoire betrays them to the Interahamwe, who use radio broadcasts to accost them. After giving General Bizimungu the remaining valuables and Scotch from his office safe to protect the refugees, Paul then admonishes Bizimungu for genocide apathy and promises to testify on his behalf for his help.\\nSoon afterward, Paul\\'s family and the hotel refugees are finally able to leave the besieged hotel in a UN convoy. They travel through retreating masses of refugees and militia to reach safety behind Tutsi rebel lines and are reunited with their nieces.\\nThe end title cards explain that Paul saved at least 1,200 Tutsi and Hutu refugees. He and his family, who adopted the two nieces, moved to Belgium, but Tatiana\\'s brother Thomas and his wife were never found. The genocide came to an end in July 1994 when the Tutsi rebels drove the Hutu and the Interahamwe militia across the border into the Congo. At least 800,000 people died in the genocide. Georges and Bizimungu were tried and sentenced for war crimes, with Georges receiving a life sentence.\\n\\n\\n== Cast'}\n"
